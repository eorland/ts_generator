1/1 - The Dispatch Jacket in Rose Cord:

We’ve all heard the saying "everything is equal"
when it comes to gear, but when it comes to our
everyday gear, the word "equality" is barely a
concept. Despite its prominent garment silhouettes
and heavy-duty materials, The Dispatch Jacket is a
casual, warm-weather option for those who’re
planning on venturing into the warmer season.
Featuring a comfortable, easygoing front layer
that’s built for those chilly fall days, durable
French terry stitch detailing, and rugged,
Responsible materials, it’s a well-built package
that’ll stand up to the roughest of environments
no matter how often you take it off.
