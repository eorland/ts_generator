      "“Utility Shirt” isn’t just some catchy nomenclature, it’s a declaration. When you’re pulling extra hours, 100% organic cotton double cloth wicks away moisture to keep you comfortable. When the situation calls for hard labor, rugged double-stitch construction and bar-tacked stress points are as work-ready as you are. And when it’s time to clean up for a meeting with the boss, a tailored silhouette and luxury touches (like dark horn buttons and a cut that stays tucked when you need it) ensure you’re looking as sharp as you feel. A single shirt that can carry you from punching in at the job to that date night reservation? Now that’s true Utility. \n",

      "As far as we’re concerned, there’s no substitute for a cozy sweater; thankfully, The Everett is no lightweight. Built with chunky 14-gauge merino wool, this cozy piece boasts an unbelievably soft hand feel (if you’re familiar with our other merino gear, you know what to expect) and an instantly arresting Navy Birdseye finish. Because merino wool regulates the body’s temperature, The Everett will keep you comfortable all year round—good news, too, because once this one’s in your rotation, you’ll want to keep it there forever.  \n",

      "Some look to calendars and weathermen to pinpoint a change in the seasons, but if you ask us, the cold season truly starts when we swap out our baseball cap for a classic knit beanie. Meet The Lodge Beanie; woven from incredibly soft baby yak wool. Easy to wear, hard to wear out, and uncompromisingly Responsible—The Lodge Beanie is how we ring in the season. \n",

      "Nothing quite says “cozy” like wrapping a warm scarf around your neck. As much a piece of essential gear for wintertime adventures as it is a stylish accessory for a chilly night out, our Lodge Scarf offers up luxurious softness and functional insulation in equal measure.  \n",

      "The game of rugby is fast and physical, requiring more than a little grit to get through a match. The same can be said about the classic rugby shirt worn on fields through history, defined by its contrasting collar, horizontal stripes, and supremely durable construction. While our take on this timeless piece of sportswear history boasts a few considered updates, like 100% organic cotton construction and a meticulously tailored fit, the heritage spirit of the sport remains strong in both its insanely durable build quality and vintage design cues.  \n",
