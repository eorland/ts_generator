Shoreline is a soft, laid-back scent featuring notes of black pepper, thyme, cinnamon, patchouli and vanilla—ideal as an everyday burner to help you wind down.

The Cotton Hemp Tee in Navy Give to Get,"Regenerative agriculture is all about reciprocity; the better we take care of the planet, the better it takes care of us.

The Chandler Jacket in Ash Donegal,"Trendy gear has a tendency to fall by the wayside only to reemerge decades later, but some styles—by virtue of their timeless good looks and utility—never fade away.

It’s not the easiest way to build a pair of boots, but doing things the easy way isn’t our style. ","This 3-oz waxed suede’s handsome Redwood finish will patina beautifully over time, developing its own completely unique character as the leather darkens and the wax works itself down into the fibers.

The Short Sleeve Jack in Indigo Seersucker,"True to its name, our signature shirt has proven to be a true Jack of all trades; taking on a wide variety of materials and colorways in style. This Short Sleeve Indigo Seersucker version is no exception. While it’s designed with warm weather in mind, we’ve preserved all of the hard wearing features that have kept The Jack at the center of our shirting roster for well over a decade. We’ve shortened the hem to be worn untucked for that billowy beach vibe, but the signature button down collar, immaculately tailored fit and clean, pleatless design mean it can clean up nicely when it's time to shake the sand out of your hair and head to dinner. ","Seersucker has been trusted for generations as a first line of defense against the sweltering sun. It’s distinctive texture helps it hang away from the skin, allowing for better airflow and quick sweat dispersion while adding some eye catching dimension to your most casual summer outfit.

The Atelier and Repairs Chino in Navy,"Sometimes, all it takes is a fresh perspective to transform the familiar into the fantastic. That’s exactly why we tapped the talents of our buddies at Atelier & Repairs to breathe some fresh life into our signature Chino. We wanted to reimagine this foundational pant as not just a staple but a look-defining centerpiece, so we handed some overstock units over to A&R founder Maurizio Donadi and let him work his magic.

The Ryder Jacket in Yoshiwa Mills Olive,"Trucker jackets are an American tradition, so it seemed fitting to build our latest take on the silhouette—The Ryder Jacket—right here in the USA.

We’ve given them a wash for some luxurious softness right out of the box, and even added a touch of stretch to the organic cotton to enhance mobility."
The Jack in Coal Jaspe Check,"Over a decade ago we set out to design the perfect shirt. Something versatile, timeless and dependable. Although we’ve made some minor changes since then (like moving to a more responsible 100% organic cotton) the core design elements have remained the same. Like a tailored fit with high armholes to prevent bunching around the chest, a measured tail that looks great tucked or untucked and a pleatless design for clean lines and easy ironing.

The Crater Shirt in Engine Plaid,"You can’t argue with The Crater Shirt’s timeless good looks (especially in this fresh Engine Plaid finish), but its soft, cozy hand feel is the real star of the show. This time around, we built it with a one-of-a-kind organic cotton twill flannel, and we gave it a heavy skin-side brushing to enhance its texture.

Our guess: it’s unlike anything you’ve ever owned before, too. ","We worked with two legendary UK-based collaborators to bring The Flatiron Jacket to life: Scotland’s Halley Stevensons provided the organic cotton dry waxed shell, while the lamb’s wool lining that adorns the lower half of the jacket’s torso was sourced from the Abraham Moon mill in England. In keeping with Holubar’s history of innovative performance gear, The Flatiron features cozy down insulation, a removable hood (complete with alpaca lining), a storm flap for protection from the elements, and a ton of pockets for storage and hand warming.

Despite its name, The Weekend Crewneck is built to serve seven days a week, sun-up to sun-down, no matter what’s on the docket.

Natural dyes are significantly easier on the environment than conventional options, so snag your favorite color and celebrate Earth Day in style. ","Because our Heavy Bag blend is built with upcycled and recycled yarns—which are shredded and respun—it emits only trace amounts of CO2 and is the first truly waterless fabric. For reference: this tee would take roughly 1,200 gallons of water to manufacture conventionally. Slight color variance resulting from the hand-dyeing process ensures that each Botanical Tee is unique. "
The Traverse Short in Wine,"Nothing beats a pair of shorts when it comes to mobility, so we teamed up with our friends at Boston’s Tracksmith to develop The Traverse Short—now available in a fresh Wine colorway. They’ve been building world-class running gear for years, and their experience (and enthusiasm) is on full display here. Everything from the materials to the fit to the features are designed to help you shave those minutes off your mile time.","The Traverse Short is cut from lightweight, four-way stretch polyester for maximum flexibility, and it comes equipped with an elastic waistband for a snug but forgiving fit. As nice as it is to run unburdened, sometimes you’ve gotta bring the essentials with you, so we added a slew of handy storage options: fixed slash pockets on the hips, a buttoned pocket on the back, and a discreet zippered mesh security pocket. Vents on the side seams keep air flowing now matter how intense your regimen gets."
The Crawford Sweater in Burgundy,"The Crawford Sweater is our elevated reimagining of the classic shawl collar cardigan, built with best-in-class materials and showcasing our characteristic penchant for heavy-duty construction.

The Hudson Sweater in Walnut,"We love the timeless look and unbeatable comfort of a classic henley, but sometimes conditions call for something a bit more substantial. Enter The Hudson Sweater, which retains the styling of your go-to henley—including a three-button front and ribbing at the cuffs, collar, and hem—but beefs it up with cozy merino wool that’ll take the bite out of even the frostiest days. Give grandma’s handiwork a rest and help yourself to The Hudson. ","Merino wool is downright incredible; not only is it exceptionally soft, it also absorbs moisture, resists odors, and regulates body temperature for all-seasons, all-conditions comfort. Racking stitch construction lends The Hudson Sweater some awesome texture, while ribbing at the collar, cuffs, and hem help keep the silhouette tidy and trim. "
The Wharf Sweater in Dark Olive,"The Wharf Sweater’s fisherman-style rib stitch construction is instantly recognizable, but we elevated our take on this cozy classic with breathable, temperature-regulating merino wool to extend its utility across all seasons. While The Wharf’s knit is voluminous and chunky, double-thick ribbing at the cuffs and collar keep the silhouette tidy, so it’ll make waves whether you wear it on its own or as a mid-layer. ","The Wharf Sweater is built with 100% merino wool, so it offers some impressive benefits over more conventional woolen knits: it regulates temperature for all-seasons comfort (keeping you cool in the summer and warm in the winter), it wicks moisture, it resists odors, and it’s surprisingly sturdy despite its soft, luxurious texture.

","This 3-oz suede boasts some rich whiskey coloring that's complemented by classic ribbing at the collar, hem, and cuffs.

We've added some extra insulation with a soft cotton twill lining in the torso, plus smooth viscose in the sleeves for quick and easy wardrobe changes."
The Able Vest in Quilted Charcoal,"You can never quite be sure what’s around the bend, so we built The Able Vest to serve as a versatile, low-profile layer that’s easy to stow away and goes with just about everything.

"
The Lined Watts Jacket in Olive,"Built for all-conditions utility, The Lined Watts Jacket is a burly, feature-rich piece of outerwear that’ll keep you warm and dry no matter how fearsome the forecast. As the name suggests, we’ve bolstered its dry waxed organic cotton shell with an ultra cozy liner, and equipped it with a protective storm flap along the front to lock out wind and rain. A two-way zipper and antique brass eyelets at the armpits allow for easy air circulation, so The Watts can hold its own even when skies are clear. ","The Watts’ 7-oz. organic cotton shell has been dry waxed for water-resistance and features some awesome herringbone texture, while its 12-oz. lining (which looks amazing thanks to its rich brown coloring) is built with a soft, cozy blend of acrylic, polyester, and recycled polyester. The silhouette is a classic, but subtle details—including cool slot buttons and snap tabs at the back for quick fit adjustments—ensure that The Watts will never blend into the background. "

We’ve equipped The Field Jacket with an array of handy pockets to stow your gear (and warm your hands) as well as reinforced shoulders and an action back for durability and more comfortable movement. When the weather calls for serious measures, reach for The Field. ","The Field Jacket is built with 9-oz. organic cotton canvas that’s been waxed by the weatherproofing experts at Halley Stevensons. We like wax because it’s easy on the environment and—unlike synthetic solutions—can be reapplied over and over again for years of protection.

The Ventana Sweater in Navy,"The Ventana Wilderness offers some of Big Sur’s most striking scenery: steep ridges, stunning waterfalls, and a notched peak which—according to legend—was once connected by a stone bridge to form a natural “window” (or ventana in Spanish).

We’ve given the material a wash to soften it up and enhance its herringbone texture, so it’ll feel like a well-loved piece from the very first time you try it on. We’ve finished the package off with some rugged YKK hardware."

These fibers are at their best when combined—give The Cotton Hemp Tee a try and we think you'll agree. "

The Heavy Bag Polo in Natural,"The Heavy Bag Polo brings precision and weight to a classic category. Here, the perennial polo is recast in a clean-fitting, heavy cotton blend that refuses to lose its shape no matter how often you wash and wear it. Menswear icons from the 60's and 70's rocked the polo as a daily driver—bridging the gap between a casual tee and a button down. In light of that, we developed a slim fitting cut in three versatile colorways that even they would be proud of.","Even the best polos won’t last forever—they shrink in the wash and the collars tend to warp—that won’t happen with the Heavy Bag. Knit from a heavyweight blend of up-cycled cotton and recycled polyester, the cotton is collected from cutting room floors in the textile industry, which is shredded, cleaned, and woven into brand new fibers. The recycled polyester goes through a similar process, and eventually the two fibers are knit together to create a thick, substantial fabric, with a remarkably soft texture. "

The Workhorse Jacket in Tobacco Boss Duck,"Do it right, or don’t do it at all; those are words to live by, and they’re at the heart of the brand new Workhorse Jacket. We’ve taken the classic, do-it-all work jacket template and beefed it up with best-in-class construction and components, including our Responsible Boss Duck blend.

The Dispatch Jacket in Khaki Cord,"The trucker jacket has steadily evolved over the years, but we’ve always admired pre-1960s iterations (characterized by prominent pleats along the front).

"
The Ojai Jacket in Natural Boss Duck,"For the first time ever, we’re combining the timeless workwear styling of The Ojai Jacket with our signature Boss Duck blend, and the results are pretty extraordinary.

","Boss Duck is our go-to workhorse material. We build it with a carefully calibrated blend of rugged hemp, recycled polyester, and organic cotton (plus a touch of stretch for extra mobility), lending it some serious sturdiness and a soft texture. Speaking of texture, we gave this iteration of The Ojai a light stone wash, so it’ll have the feel of a well-loved garment right out of the box. Whether you rock it out in the field or back at the office, one thing’s for sure: hard work has never looked quite so fresh. "

Plus, it’s so comfy, you might find yourself reaching for it on recovery days, too. ","Merino wool is something of a miracle fiber—especially for athletes. Not only is it exceptionally comfortable, it regulates the body’s temperature, it absorbs sweat, it’s antimicrobial (or as we like to say, anti-stink), and it’s low-maintenance. We blended this midweight (18.5 micron) merino with a synthetic performance fiber called polypropylene to give it some extra durability and resistance to stains and fading, and finished The Shoreline off with some handsome cat’s eye buttons. "

We worked around the clock to concoct a uniquely resilient hemp-based blend that's incredibly comfortable and responsibly built.

The California in Midnight Slub Micro Stripe,"Call us sentimental, but we’ll always have room in our closets for shirts that—though they might bear some battle scars—have been with us for years, fit like a glove, and feel like heaven. The latest iteration of our signature California is a recreation of that one-of-a-kind comfort, boasting a uniquely soft, slubby texture that we’ve enhanced with a garment wash. We’ll leave the battle scars to you. ","This 4-oz organic cotton has a ton of character thanks to its slubby texture, and because it’s been garment washed it’ll feel lived-in from the very first time you try it on. This iteration of The California features the style’s signature casual collar, rounded cuffs, handy chest pocket, and a tailored fit with high armholes. Tucked or untucked, it looks like a million bucks. "
The Jack in Melange Navy Plaid,"We’ve been making shirts for over a decade, and we’re proud of every single piece that bears the Taylor Stitch name. That said, The Jack, for all its simplicity, might just be our magnum opus. Over the years, the style has seen countless iterations, but its core formula—a tailored fit, peerless craftsmanship, and superior materials—is the same as ever. Bottom line: if you want to know what top-shelf shirting feels like, start here. ","We don’t mess around when it comes to shirting—this is premium stuff, cut from environmentally friendly organic cotton and Responsibly Built For The Long Haul. We gave this Melange Navy Plaid edition of The Jack a wash, so it’s got a soft, luxurious texture. If it looks amazing, and it feels amazing, it might just be amazing. "
The Jack in Parkway Stripe,"Though we've grown exponentially over the years, expanding well beyond our humble origins as a dedicated shirtmaking operation, The Jack remains a critical fixture of our roster—and is perhaps the purest expression of our history. The Jack may be simple, but what it lacks in bells and whistles, it makes up for with peerless construction, a perfectly tailored cut, and Responsible materials that can withstand the ups and downs of daily wear without putting undue stress on our planet. If you want to know what Taylor Stitch is all about, give The Jack a try. ","This 4-oz 100% organic cotton is lightweight, breathable, and sturdy, and we've given it a wash to enhance its naturally soft texture. Striped shirts can occasionally overpower an ensemble, but this subtle, vintage-inspired Parkway Stripe finish will play nice with just about everything in your closet. The Jack features high armholes for a tidy look, and looks great both tucked or untucked. "
The Utility Shirt in Indigo Crosshatch,"The Utility Shirt proves once and for all that function doesn't have to come at the expense of form.

When there's a job to be done, The Utility is as essential as a well-stocked toolbox. Grab yours and get to work. ","This 5-oz 100% organic cotton is soft and sturdy, and features a finely textured Crosshatch weave that will age beautifully with wear. The Utility Shirt earns its name with a handful of pragmatic design elements, including handy button-through chest pockets, resilient aluminum buttons, and a tailored silhouette that looks great tucked or untucked. "
The Ledge Shirt in Sand Plaid,"Some shirts give out halfway up the mountain—not The Ledge. Equipped with our easygoing California collar, a shorter length (perfect for wearing untucked), and our characteristically meticulous construction, The Ledge is a sharp, comfortable option that can hold its own even when the trail gets bumpy.","We’ve washed this 7-oz organic cotton to give it a super soft, lived-in hand feel right out of the box. The Ledge features sturdy double needle felled construction—plus lockstitched buttons and buttonholes—so you don’t have to worry about any loose threads distracting you from the task at hand. Natural buttons round out this exceptionally handsome Sand Plaid finish. "
The Polo in Dark Navy Jacquard,"The Polo is an undisputed classic, combining a sharp, tidy look with comfort and ruggedness befitting the sport for which it was originally devised. We’ve taken this time-tested formula and given it a TS punch-up, starting with a custom-developed jacquard knit that adds a ton of unique character and textural nuance. Good looks aside, The Polo’s meticulous construction and top-quality components make it an easy choice, on and off the field, for years to come. ","We’ve added a touch of spandex to this 6-oz organic cotton for some extra comfort and flexibility, and we’ve equipped The Polo with durable rubber buttons and organic cotton ribbing throughout. This custom-developed jacquard knit is subtle when viewed from afar, but its intricate pattern really sets our take on this well-loved silhouette apart from the crowd. "

","We don’t need to tell you what makes cotton so great. It’s soft, it’s versatile, and it’s low-maintenance. Unfortunately, all of those benefits come with some pretty serious caveats, including a reliance on harmful chemicals and wasteful cultivation practices. That’s why we’ve transitioned to organic cotton, not only with The Organic Cotton Tee, but with more than 99% of our cotton-based products.

The Welterweight Winslow in Olive Dry Waxed Canvas,"Our famed Winslow Parka is beloved for its heft and impenetrability, but it might be a bit too cozy for milder climates. That's why we developed The Welterweight Winslow, a pared down take on this TS staple that offers the same impressive protection from the elements in a streamlined package. This new Olive Dry Waxed Canvas colorway looks fantastic, and thanks to an array of awesome details—cozy lining, custom YKK hardware, and natural leather accents—it'll remain a contender even when the skies are clear. ","We developed The Welterweight Winslow's 6-oz Dry Waxed Canvas shell in collaboration with the weatherproofing wizards at Halley Stevensons in Scotland—they've been perfecting their craft for over 150 years, so you can count on their handiwork to keep you bone dry no matter the size of the storm. We've deployed a variety of different types of lining—organic cotton throughout the body, smooth acetate in the sleeves for easy changing, wool in the hand warmer pockets—to keep things cozy without unnecessary bulk. "
The Long Haul Jacket in Cone Mills Reserve Selvage,"We’ve developed some amazing denims in partnership with some amazing mills over the years, but we’ll always have a soft spot for Cone Mills. The legendary North Carolina mill may no longer be in operation, but it’ll always be an important chapter in the Taylor Stitch story, and we were ecstatic when we recently discovered a trove of deadstock selvage denim straight from the source and ripe for the cuttin’. The Long Haul Jacket in Cone Mills Reserve is one piece of history that’s far too handsome for a museum—get out there and make it your own.","Upon its closure in 2017, Cone Mills left some mighty big shoes to fill—after all, they were industry leaders and the last of their kind operating in the US—and their hard-won reputation for superior quality is on full display in the latest iteration of The Long Haul Jacket. This 100% cotton selvage denim weighs in at 13 ounces—substantial without slowing you down—and will break in and fade beautifully as you put it through its paces. Per tradition, we’ve included our signature Long Haul detailing: custom SF map print pocketing, zig zag reinforcements, and custom YKK hardware."
The Meier Jack in White Everyday Oxford,There’s one simple reason we call this our everyday oxford; we wear them pretty much every single day.,"Just the right amount of sturdy for year round wear. Soft to the touch but built for a decade of solid wear. Oxford is a perfectly versatile fabric that looks just as good pressed as it does pulled off the back of a chair.

The Meier Short Sleeve Heavy Bag Henley in Natural,"Cut from the same fan-favorite fabric found in The Heavy Bag Tee, our Short Sleeve Henleys are about twice the weight of a standard cotton t-shirt, but oh-so-very soft.

The cotton is collected from cutting room floors in the textile industry, which are then shredded, and cleaned to create brand new fibers. The recycled polyester is cleaned and re-extruded into new thread, with absolutely no loss of quality. In time, the two threads are knit together to create a hearty, substantial fabric with a remarkably soft texture."

The Fourtillfour Ojai Jacket in Washed Charcoal,"The hard-driving durability of a chore coat meets the timeless sophistication of a blazer. We screen-printed the number 4 over the pocket and custom-emroidered ""Sunday Motor Club"" on the back of the jacket to commemorate our collaboration with the team at Fourtillfour. This tailored canvas jacket lends a dash of functional style to your daily uniform. We love chore coats for their endless versatility, and this style transforms from a functional work-bench jacket to an unstructured blazer with a quick splay of the collar.","When we sourced sateen for the original Ojai, we were especially taken with the way it aged. After a few wears, its subtle sheen gave way to tremendous nuance in both texture and color. In the interest of putting an already stellar garment's best foot forward, we've given the latest Ojai a gently washed finish. It's lightweight enough to be worn under something heavier, but don't be surprised if you prefer to show it off."
The Jack in Brushed Forest Oxford,"Like all those fall traditions you can’t help but indulge in year after year, The Jack is a classic that somehow never gets old.

The Camp Pant in Charcoal Corduroy,"We've always had a soft spot for corduroy—it's hard to beat that killer texture—but it takes some know-how to keep it from looking like a relic of a bygone era. Luckily, our Camp Pant silhouette is timeless, and thanks to some rugged construction (including bar tack reinforcements at stress points), you won't have to worry about your pair breaking down before they've reached their peak. ","Most corduroy requires a bit of babying—not to mention drycleaning for upkeep—but this 11-oz 100% organic cotton cord can take a beating (and a machine wash) without batting an eye. Garment washed for a soft, lived-in feel, and accented with signature details like SF map print pocketing and YKK hardware, The Camp Pant will serve as the perfect companion well into next year. "
The Bomber Sweater in Black Sesame,"If the fast-approaching autumn chill has got you feeling down, don't worry—we've got you covered with the brand new Bomber Sweater in Black Sesame! This unbelievably handsome jacket/sweater hybrid is built from extrafine merino wool, and it's guaranteed to keep you cozy through even the most fearsome cold fronts. Featuring a classic bomber-style collar and tonal cat's eye buttons, The Bomber Sweater is ideal as a mid-weight layer or a piece of comfy outerwear on mild days. ","Merino wool is downright miraculous. It's soft, sturdy, offers an exceptional warmth-to-weight ratio, regulates temperature and manages moisture—the list goes on and on, and the extrafine merino we sourced for The Bomber Sweater has an especially fine, luxurious texture—a far cry from the itchy woolen sweaters of yesteryear. We used a mixture of black and charcoal yarns to add some extra textural depth, and tied the whole thing together with some awesome tonal cat's eye buttons. "
The Seafarer Sweater in Natural Donegal,"We love summer, but we'll be the first to admit that wintertime has some undeniable appeal: the holiday gatherings, the preponderance of warm beverages, and—last but not least—the chance to layer up. The brand new Seafarer Sweater in Natural Donegal is one piece we're particularly excited to introduce into our ensembles this year. It's made from a cozy merino-dominant blend, it's lightweight and not too chunky, and it's got an awesome mock neck collar and striking flecked finish. Winter's ""pros"" column just got a little bit longer. ","The Seafarer Sweater's unique blend of extrafine merino wool, nylon, and alpaca capitalizes on the strengths of its constituent fibers for some next level comfort and durability. On top of being super soft, merino wool offers exceptional temperature regulation, moisture management, and antimicrobial (AKA anti-stink) properties. Nylon bolsters durability, while a touch of alpaca adds some luxurious texture, making The Seafarer Sweater an awesome, eye-catching all-rounder that you'll be reaching for all winter long. "
The Lined Long Haul Jacket in Harvest Tan Dry Wax,"A central pillar of the Taylor Stitch lineup, The Long Haul Jacket is a hard-wearing everyday jacket with a tailored cut and some awesome detailing. This time around, we've given that classic formula a not-so-subtle upgrade with a cozy blanket lining and a dry waxed finish courtesy of the industry legends at Halley Stevensons. Next time a big storm breaks, you won't have to leave your favorite jacket at home—this Long Haul can take it. ","This 9-oz organic cotton canvas has been treated with dry wax to give it a fighting chance against the elements. As its name suggests, dry wax feels dry to the touch, thereby avoiding the occasionally sticky texture of heavier wax treatments. We’ve gone a step further and bolstered this Long Haul Jacket with a 13-oz blanket liner that’s soft, cozy, and adds some extra heft to keep the cold at bay."
The Gibson Jacket in Charcoal Birdseye Wool,"The Gibson may have been devised as the perfect travel companion—it's got the passport pockets to prove it—but it's so darn sharp that we find ourselves pulling it out of the closet even when our itinerary doesn't take us much further than the corner market. That goes doubly for this new Charcoal Birdseye colorway, which boasts all of the tidy design and utility-focused detailing of the original in a burly, beautiful woolen finish that keeps the Gibson soaring above the competition.","This 13-oz wool-dominant blend is warm, substantial, and features some beautiful birdseye donegal texture. Drawing inspiration from vintage, occasion-agnostic 3-roll, 2-button military-style jackets, The Gibson features extra buttons and a removable throat latch so it can transition from casual to formal with a flick of the wrist. With a sophisticated look, a slew of handy features, and materials that let it spring to life even after a long journey in a suitcase, The Gibson is everything we'd want in a travel companion—or an everyday jacket, for that matter.

The Camp Pant in Heather Grey Wool,"It might feel a bit early to start planning for cold weather, but picture this: the days are short, the air is chill, but you barely notice because you've got a mug of something warm and some cozy woolen pants to see you through until the next thaw. That's where the latest Camp Pant comes in—this woolen take on one of our signature workwear silhouettes is sharp, rugged, and incredibly comfortable. They'll ship out right when you'll need them—just make sure to sort out what's going into your mug beforehand. ","These 10-oz woolen trousers are burly but have a super soft hand; perfect for chillier days when you’re hopping straight into the action after a day on the job. As much as we love wool, it can be a bit itchy, which is why we've blended some polyester into this mix, which not only softens the material up but also gives it some extra strength and resistance to wrinkles. "
The Jack in Charcoal Crepe,"It takes a long time to build up an arsenal of reliable year-round shirting options. The Jack is here to take the guesswork out of that process with its tastefully tailored cut, classic, straightforward design, and rock-solid construction. Best of all, once you've settled on a size, you've got a huge variety of awesome variations to choose from—and to look forward to.  ","This lightweight, 100% organic cotton features a crepe weave, giving it some fantastic textural depth and a subtle salt-and-pepper look. Regular cotton is popular for good reason—it's breathable, absorbent, and soft—but its cultivation takes a major toll on the environment. This organic cotton offers those exact same benefits without relying on harmful chemicals or wasting obscene amounts of water and electricity. Feels good, doesn't it?"
The Camp Pant in Dark Moss Wool,"It might feel a bit early to start planning for cold weather, but picture this: the days are short, the air is chill, but you barely notice because you've got a mug of something warm and some cozy woolen pants to see you through until the next thaw.

"
The Harris Jacket in Forest Dry Wax,"Traditional styling conspires with a suite of modern, technical features to make for a timeless piece of outerwear that doesn't live in the past. The Harris Jacket's classic look belies some thoughtful, utilitarian design: a weather-resistant outer shell, a packable hood, an array of useful pockets, and more. Of course, even if action, adventure, and foul weather aren't on the day's docket, you'll be glad for The Harris' good looks and exceptional comfort. Plus, who ever said 'no' to an extra pocket or two? ","Alongside a storm flap on the front placket and pockets featuring hidden snaps, we gave The Harris Jacket's lightweight organic cotton shell a water-resistant finish for total protection from the elements. For extra warmth and insulation, we used a super soft 7-oz brushed organic cotton lining. An internal drawcord at the waist allows for on-the-fly fit adjustments, and antique brass YKK hardware adds a touch of vintage flavor to this handsome, all-purpose jacket. "
The Wilton Jacket in Navy Birdseye Wool,"What makes The Wilton special? It's all in the layers. An ultra cozy recycled polyester fill sandwiched between a sturdy—not to mention gorgeous—birdseye wool shell and a brushed organic cotton lining makes donning this jacket feel a lot like wrapping yourself up in your favorite blanket. An eye-catching wave quilting pattern ties everything together, giving The Wilton a completely unique look that's sure to take some of the sting out of those chilly autumn nights. ","For the shell, we used a 7-oz blend of 80% wool and 20% polyester that provides optimal warmth without weighing you down. The lining is made from 100% organic cotton and has been  brushed for softness. Finally, we used recycled polyester for the fill—polyester is great in this context because it's lightweight and maintains its insulating properties even when wet. An array of handy pockets and YKK antique brass hardware round out this exceptional piece of outerwear."
The Heavy Bag Tee in Black,"Durability is key when you're choosing a jacket, or jeans, or a pair of shoes, right? Why should a t-shirt be any different? We took the soft touch of your favorite years-old tee and beefed it up. Rugged, but with a gentler side, this heavyweight is ready to slide to the top of your tee rotation. ","Because The Heavy Bag Tee uses upcycled and recycled yarns—which are shredded and respun—it emits only trace amounts of CO2 and is the first truly waterless fabric. For reference: this tee would take roughly 1,200 gallons of water to manufacture conventionally. "

The Decker Jacket in Wool Beach Cloth,"Herbert Decker was a carpenter and shipwright who, right around the turn of the 20th century, set up shop in a modest workshop in Maine. After a long and illustrious career, it came time to hang up his tools and retire, so he sold the space to a younger friend and fellow woodworker by the name of Ross Stuart Thompson—who, many years later, would become our co-founder Michael Maher's grandfather. On a recent trip back east to see his folks, Michael paid a visit to that same ""boat shop"" (as the family calls it) and made an incredible discovery: an authentic Brown's Beach Cloth jacket peeking out from under an old tarp. Some sleuthing revealed that this jacket's original owner was none other than Herbert Decker, and that the piece itself is upwards of a century old! Barring a handful of updates, The Decker Jacket is a faithful recreation of that long-forgotten, tarp-covered treasure—a real piece of history, ready for the next chapter. ","Our admiration for Brown's Beach Cloth—its place in history, its longevity—is no secret, so we're chalking our founder's discovery up to fate. For the uninitiated, Beach Cloth was a closet staple in the early 20th century (right around the time Herbert Decker purchased his), especially among laborers whose work subjected them to chilly, darn conditions—seafarers, loggers, etc. Although we've cleaned up the construction and given it some slight updates (adjustable cuffs, a larger, more modern collar, etc.), The Decker Jacket is built to the same specifications as the remarkably resilient piece that inspired it. Now all you have to worry about is making sure your descendents have a good story to tell when they inherit yours. "
The Gibson Jacket in Olive Herringbone Wool,"The Gibson may have been devised as the perfect travel companion—it's got the passport pockets to prove it—but it's so darn sharp that we find ourselves pulling it out of the closet even when our itinerary doesn't take us much further than the corner market.

With a sophisticated look, a slew of handy features, and materials that let it spring to life even after a long journey in a suitcase, The Gibson is everything we'd want in a travel companion—or an everyday jacket, for that matter. "
The Crater Shirt in Blue Plaid,"The aptly named Crater Shirt made a big impact when it first appeared on the TS roster. What it lacks in bells and whistles (unless we're counting the snazzy cats eye buttons) it more than makes up for with some timeless good looks and rugged construction. Cut from a midweight organic cotton flannel, this iteration of The Crater has been brushed inside and out for some exceptional comfort that only gets better with age. ","This 9-oz brushed flannel was custom developed for Taylor Stitch using 100% organic cotton. All of The Crater Shirt’s no-nonsense features return, including utility-focused chest pockets, classy cats eye buttons, and our refined California collar. This fresh plaid colorway is both eye-catching and versatile—the perfect combination for a daily driver. "
The Fisherman Sweater in Heather Ash,"What better way to ease into the end-of-year chill than a big, comfy sweater? Over the years, The Fisherman Sweater has become a big part of how we celebrate the season, whether that means grabbing one to stay warm all winter long, or gifting one—in all likelihood, gifting several—to loved ones. This year has been a bit of a rollercoaster, so we're extra happy to have this cozy, chunky sweater to look forward to as we're crossing the finish line. ","We used 100% merino wool for this iteration of The Fisherman Sweater, which means it's got an exceptional warmth-to-weight ratio and is very soft (don't worry about getting itchy—merino is significantly finer than regular old coarse wool). We wouldn't blame you for thinking such a hefty looking sweater would only come in handy during the colder months, but merino wool's many strengths include its ability to regulate the body's temperature—hot or cold—and to wick moisture. All we're saying is, don't be hasty in packing The Fisherman away when winter's over. "
The Quilted Jacket in Indigo Boss Duck,"No wardrobe is complete without a reliable mid-weight jacket—one you can reach for first thing in the morning that'll carry you through a full day without skipping a beat. The Quilted Jacket fills that role with rare distinction, combining timeless good looks with a suite of killer features to ensure you're ready for whatever's on the horizon. Ample storage, cozy insulation, and some signature detailing make The Quilted Jacket more than just another pretty face; this is a piece you can count on today, tomorrow, and for many years to come. ","This jacket's outer layer is built with Boss Duck, a hemp-based blend that offers incredible durability and out-of-the-box comfort in equal measure. Complementing this tough-as-nails shell is a super soft 9-oz organic cotton blanket lining to keep things oh-so cozy. And of course, true to its name, The Quilted Jacket features a gorgeous diamond quilt pattern that's insulated with 100% recycled polyester for some extra protection from the cold. Antique brass hardware, an array of handy pockets, and a modern dropped-back hem further establish The Quilted Jacket as an early frontrunner in the race for winter wear superiority. "
The Hardtack Sweater in Navy Donegal,"Lightweight, luxuriously soft, and handsome as all get-out, this year's iteration of The Hardtack Sweater is slated to ship out just in time to beat back even the most ruthless coldfront. With its classic sheepskin elbow patches and beautifully understated donegal finish, The Hardtack is one of our all-time favorite autumnal layers. Like the changing colors of the leaves, we look forward to it every year.","Yak wool offers the same insulating properties and irresistible softness of cashmere—in fact, many argue that it's even softer—but it's more durable, offers better heat-retention, and it's sourced responsibly. Yaks thrive naturally with little food, and because they aren't confined to small plots of land like many other domesticated animals, their relative environmental impact is negligible. As they start shedding their plush undercoats in the springtime, the finest fibers are simply combed out and cleaned for use. Give those cashmere goats (and the land they graze) a well earned-break and say yes to yak. "

The Cuyama Jacket in Cognac,"The Cuyama Jacket is modeled after one of our lead designer Nick Kemp's luckiest secondhand shop finds (believe it or not, he has an eye for vintage menswear). You know you can count on meticulous craftsmanship and some exceptional materials (just look at that leather) but it's the Cuyama's idiosyncrasies that really set it apart. Cellar door-style side-entry pockets, distinctive corduroy detailing throughout, and gorgeous corozo buttons give this jacket some completely unique character. We propose a toast—to keeping our eyes on the future without losing sight of the past. ","This gorgeous 4-oz cowhide leather features a spectacular pull-up that will emerge over time. Like a glass of fine cognac, it's at its best only after it's had a chance to mature. Cotton twill lining through the torso gives The Cuyama Jacket extra heft, while beautiful natural horn corozo buttons and wide wale corduroy collar detailing imbue this timeless garment with some one-of-a-kind visual impact. "
The Camp Pant in Indigo Corduroy,"We've always had a soft spot for corduroy—it's hard to beat that killer texture—but it takes some know-how to keep it from looking like a relic of a bygone era. Luckily, our Camp Pant silhouette is timeless, and thanks to some rugged construction (including bar tack reinforcements at stress points), you won't have to worry about your pair breaking down before they've reached their peak. ","Most corduroy requires a gentle touch (and drycleaning for upkeep) but this 9-oz 100% organic cotton cord lives up to the rugged reputation of past iterations of The Camp Pant. Thanks to the rich indigo dye, these trousers will fade beautifully with each wear and wash. Given enough time, they'll develop some distinctive character unique to each wearer—just like a pair of classic blue jeans. "
The Headland Sweater in Marled Navy,"The Headland Sweater—named for the coast-dominating headlands that provide unparalleled seaside vantages—is built to accompany you during those perspective-expanding moments. Its classic coloring will keep you looking sharp for decades to come, while the cozy texture will provide enough warmth for the harshest of seasons. Steel yourself against the elements, get comfortable, and take it all in. ","This cotton-dominant blend is soft, sharp, and exceptionally cozy. Since The Headland was inspired by the coast, we opted for an easy-to-layer mid-weight heavy knit to keep the sea breeze at bay. Even when you find yourself further inland, you'll appreciate The Headland's gorgeous marled texture, its substantial, double-ribbed neckline and cuffs, and its timeless good looks. "
The Long Haul Jacket in Moss Brushed Reverse Sateen,"From classic denim to waffle-woven cotton, from waxed canvas to burly boiled wool, The Long Haul Jacket's versatility knows no bounds. Given our newfound appreciation for reversed sateen—material you'd no doubt come across at a well-stocked military surplus—it was only a matter of time before we built a Long Haul out of the stuff. To keep things extra fresh, we brushed this sateen for some awesome texture, but otherwise, you know what to expect here: world-class materials, meticulous construction, and good looks that'll never go out of style. ","If you've encountered our other 100% organic cotton Reverse Sateen gear (The Camp Pant, The Trail Short, The Ojai), the premise here is similar, although we opted for a slightly heavier variant this time around, and we brushed it to keep things cozy. If you're new to the party, sateen is in the twill family (like denim or khaki), and it's noted for its incredibly soft texture. Unfortunately, it's often prone to snagging, which is why we've reversed it: the soft ""face"" rests against the skin, while the durable ""self"" is exposed to the elements. Signature SF map print pocketing, custom YKK hardware and zigzag reinforcement stitching round out this fresh take on a classic. "
The Fourtillfour Heavy Bag Tee in Ash Stripe,"A heavyweight tailored tee cut from up-cycled cotton and recycled polyester. We screen-printed the number 4 over the pocket to commemorate our collaboration with the team at Fourtillfour. Cut slim, this tee is pre-shrunk for a perfect, consistent fit you can wash time and again. After studying vintage tees, we noticed that they tended to bust out in the shoulders, so we added a fully-taped shoulder seam to the Heavy Bag to prevent ripping. ","A heavyweight striped blend of up-cycled cotton and recycled polyester. The cotton is collected from cutting room floors in the textile industry, which is shredded, cleaned, and woven into brand new fibers. The recycled polyester goes through a similar process, and eventually the two fibers are knit together to create a substantial fabric, with a surprisingly soft texture."
The Fourtillfour Ojai Jacket in Natural Reverse Sateen,"The hard-driving durability of a chore coat meets the timeless sophistication of a blazer. We screen-printed the number 4 over the pocket and custom-emroidered ""Sunday Motor Club"" on the back of the jacket to commemorate our collaboration with the team at Fourtillfour. This tailored canvas jacket lends a dash of functional style to your daily uniform. We love chore coats for their endless versatility, and this style transforms from a functional work-bench jacket to an unstructured blazer with a quick splay of the collar.","A mid-weight reverse sateen fabric milled from a sturdy blend of 100% recycled cotton. Natural, un-dyed fabric is a magnet for patina—from motor oil to coffee stains, this coat tells a story on your sleeve."

We think Mr. Strauss would be proud. ","The Everyday Jean will look and feel familiar to the TS faithful, but we've streamlined this run by switching to a classic zipper fly and opting for a slightly shorter inseam that's ideal for cuffing.

Signature SF-map print pocketing and YKK hardware round out a pair of jeans that, as the name suggests, you'll look forward to wearing every single day. "

The Yosemite Shirt in Arid Camo,"We can hardly believe it's been eight years since we built our very first Yosemite shirt; a lot has changed since then, but we're very happy to report that this TS staple has stayed the course to great effect. Barring one not-so-minor update—we use 100% organic cotton nowadays—we've seen no reason to mess with the formula over the years; it remains an unbelievably comfy shirt with some rugged construction, a refined silhouette, and the kind of understated good looks that never go out of style.

The Bomber Jacket in Washed Slate Herringbone,"Sometimes a little innovation goes a long way, which is why we left our time-tested Bomber silhouette alone and decided to focus on introducing some fresh color and texture into the mix for this iteration.

Handmade in León, Mexico, our Moto Boot boasts total durability, a rugged double-leather cap toe, and an effortless break-in.

"
The Ojai Jacket in Tobacco,"For all its old school appeal, The Ojai has proven itself to be an exceedingly versatile template for experimentation: from heavy woolen blends to dry-waxed canvas, this classic workwear silhouette has yet to meet a material it doesn't like. That's why we didn't have to think twice about our brand new Tobacco iteration, which is sturdy, soft, and absolutely beautiful. The details—natural ring-back buttons, ample storage space, and a tailored cut—remain unchanged, but this Ojai has a character all its own. ","Sateen is in the twill family (like denim or khaki), but it's significantly softer. Unfortunately, it's also prone to snagging, which is why we've taken this 100% organic cotton sateen and reversed it: the soft ""face"" rests against the skin, and the durable ""self"" is exposed to the elements. We've even given this run a wash to enhance its naturally smooth texture. The resulting material is remarkably comfortable, sturdy, and sharp."

We'll leave the fun part—breaking it in—to you. ","This is a custom-milled, 12-oz kitchen sink canvas—it's got a little bit of everything in it. Hemp is easy on the environment and lasts forever, but it can be rough on the skin, which is why we blended it with a healthy dose of recycled polyester and organic cotton. A touch of stretch ensures you won't have to worry about rips and tears while you're putting your new jacket through its paces, and a light stone wash ensures it'll feel well-loved from day one. "
The Après Hoodie in Indigo Waffle,"It'll be readily apparent to anyone who's been following the brand over the last few years just how much we love an indigo-dyed waffle weave. We've made everything from shorts to shirts to full-fledged jackets out of the stuff, and it continues to floor us every single time. That's why, when it came time to slap a new coat of paint on our ultra-cozy Après Hoodie, this iteration was a no brainer. It's rare that a hoodie looks better with age, but hey, this ain't your average hoodie. ","What makes our Indigo Waffle so special? For starters, it weighs in at a hefty 10 ounces and is woven from 100% organic cotton, which means it can take a beating without dishing one out to the planet. It looks fantastic right out of the box, but after a couple of wears and washes, something special happens: as the indigo dye begins to fade, the waffle pattern becomes more pronounced and multifaceted, giving way to a totally unique and eye-catching finish. Trust us, you'll wanna stick around for the finale. "
The Jack in Charcoal Fleck,"The Jack is our idea of the perfect everyday shirt—not just because it's sturdy and versatile, but because it looks so good you'll want to wear it every single day. Combining a tailored cut, classic design, and rugged construction, this is a truly timeless piece of menswear that you'll be happy to count as a daily driver for many years to come. ","We've supplemented this lightweight and soft organic cotton with a little bit of linen for some added strength and breathability. It feels fantastic—especially on warmer days—but the real star of the show here is the beautiful fleck finish, which adds a tremendous amount of texture and depth to what is otherwise a rather understated look.

The Hart Piston,"Inspired by a vintage FFA jacket our Product Designer, Nick purchased while back home in Texas, our new Piston Jacket takes on the classic Harrington silhouette, rendered in rich, organic cotton indigo corduroy.

The Jack Mason x Taylor Stitch Aviator Multi‑Scale Chronograph,"Inspired by chronographs from the 1930’s, the Jack Mason x Taylor Stitch Aviator Multi-Scale Chronograph taps into the “golden age of aviation” when early aviation pioneers relied on functionality and versatility.

The Ojai Jacket in Navy Boiled Wool,"A rugged chore coat that doubles as a blazer. Much ink has been spilled about ‘versatility,’ but how many blazers can you actually wear at the work bench? The Ojai is a slim-fitting chore coat with loads of pocket, cut from a hearty boiled wool that takes a beating and cleans up nice.","Boiled wool is a miracle fibre that retains heat and keeps the wind off your back, and this heavy-duty specimen is no exception. Boiled wool tends to itch, but we blended ours with a soft-spun nylon that can be worn directly on the skin."
The Moto Jacket in Whiskey Steerhide,"Few pieces on the Taylor Stitch roster demonstrate our unwavering commitment to peerless craftsmanship and timeless design better than The Moto Jacket. As always, 2021’s run of this signature silhouette is built by hand right here in San Francisco by the legendary team at Golden Bear using premium 3.5-oz. full-grain leather. Packed with road-ready features like a two-way YKK zipper, articulated shoulders, and low-profile Thinsulate™ insulation, The Moto Jacket is the genuine article: an honest-to-goodness heirloom that’ll look and feel great—on or off a bike—for decades to come.

The Jack in Washed Charcoal Dobby,"A natural fit for our collaboration with Stetson, The Jack is classic and forward-thinking all at once. The signature template—trim fit, button down collar, rounded chest pocket—returns in a beautifully textured organic cotton dobby. It’s easy on the planet and even easier on the eyes. ","Better with every wear and built for the long haul, the stunning texture of this dobby cloth is woven on a particular type of loom called—you guessed it—a dobby loom. Invented in the 1840s, the loom can lift and drop the warp (vertical threads) separately, which results in a beautifully textured fabric that subtly stands out in a crowd."
The Long Haul Jacket in Green Cast Selvage,"The timeless styling and cut are the same as ever, but for this iteration of The Long Haul, we’ve worked with a new dyeing process that introduces a slight greenish hue that deepens over time as the indigo fades. Built to wear in and not out, this limited piece is ready to step boldly into the future while standing the test of time for decades to come. ","This 100% organic cotton weighs in at 14-oz, making it a touch heavier than our other denim offerings. Featuring a slubby, low-tension weave, this jacket will feel fantastic on the first wear (and even better on the thousandth). As its name suggests, Green Cast Denim introduces green sulphur into the dyeing process, giving these jeans a uniquely greenish undertone that reveals itself gradually as the more traditional indigo dye fades. If your denim collection is starting to look a little humdrum, why not go green? "
The Slim Jean in Green Cast Selvage,"The Taylor Stitch story may have started with shirting, but in many ways it hit its stride with denim. We love the stuff—not only for its inimitable look, its tendency to feel better after each wash and wear, and its ruggedness, but also because it provides ample opportunity for experimentation. Our collaboration with the trailblazers at Stetson seemed like the perfect time to unveil our first foray into Green Cast Selvage Denim, which offers exactly what you’ve come to expect from a pair of phenomenally constructed jeans while introducing just enough of a twist to keep things interesting.

The Mechanic Shirt in Black Reverse Sateen,"The Mechanic Shirt is what we imagine when we think of the perfect work shirt. It’s not something you have to second guess when you’re getting ready in the morning, and it’s built to survive a full day and then some. We’ve made some tweaks to the latest batch—they’re now made with 100% organic cotton, for example—but the central premise remains unchanged: when there’s a job to be done, grab The Mechanic. ","Reminiscent of many types of military combat uniforms, this midweight organic cotton reverse sateen is exceptionally sturdy, and it’ll look even better after you’ve put it through its paces a few times. This iteration of The Mechanic has also been garment washed, which not only softens it up for a nicer hand feel but also emphasizes its unique, slubby texture. "

The Cash Shirt in Indigo Sashiko,"Sashiko is a centuries old Japanese weaving technique characterized by a strong, vertical weft thread that gives the fabric it’s substantial texture. The Cash takes its cut and construction cues from a vintage workwear button ups, with a pointed chest flap pocket, and double-needle workwear stitching throughout. Japanese-inspired fabric and timeless workwear construction–it’s as good as Cash.","Traditional Sashiko weaving gives this fabric it’s substantial texture—it’s the same fabric you’ll find on a martial arts gi, except ours is quite a bit lighter. The cotton is dyed in vats of indigo, then woven into sashiko fabric, cut and sewn into this fine button-up shirt, and washed down to a breathable, buttery softness."
The Port Jacket in Navy Sherpa,"We set out to build a foul weather coat with the planet in mind. The Port Jacket is remarkably simple—two welt pockets cover-stitched onto a slim silhouette with a stand-up collar. The fabric is a warm, insulating 15 oz. polyester fleece made entirely out of recycled plastic bottles. For hardware, we sourced custom Taylor Stitch antique brass snaps with our bear stamp. From the rugged construction and hearty recycled fleece, this minimal coat truly embodies our commitment to crafting quality goods, responsibly built for the long haul. ","This jacket is cut from a hearty 15 oz. recycled polyester sherpa fleece with a cozy, quarter inch pile. Derived from recycled water bottles, this fabric boasts the same loft and softness as virgin polyester, and was specifically developed to resist pilling and retain heat. Fleece tends to bell out and stretch over time, so we added a bonded fleece interior to reinforce the shape, and sturdy elastic binding to the edge seams for added fit reinforcement."
The Moto Utility Shirt in Indigo Pindot,"A slim button down forged from hearty organic cotton. Cut with double chest pockets and triple needle chain-stitch construction, this shirt has all the dependability and function of a jacket with a quarter of the bulk. Traditional work shirts tend to be cut long. Our Moto Utility Shirt is meticulously engineered to lay right untucked, and the sturdy organic cotton will last years, while the slim fit lends a tailored edge to this hard-wearing classic.","Organic cotton woven in a subtle pin-dot pattern. The mid-weight fabric weighs 8oz per square yard (and there’s about a yard and a half in every shirt). The texture is crisp at first, but softens up nicely over time. The organic yarn is vat-dyed in indigo, so you should see subtle fading with each wash and wear."
The Western Shirt in Natural Corded Denim,"What better way to honor our collaboration with Stetson than with a brand new iteration of our ever-popular Western silhouette? Vintage-inspired details like angled chest pockets and authentic YKK snaps make it easy to channel your inner cowboy, but thanks to a sophisticated cut and 100% organic materials, The Western is as at home in the big city as it is out on the range. ","This 6-oz organic cotton corduroy has been given a light wash to enhance its naturally soft texture, so it’ll feel like it’s a well-loved favorite right from the jump. Bar-tack reinforcements throughout add some extra visual flourish—and ensure that The Western Shirt will be ready to ride for the long haul. "
The Chore Pant in Indigo Boss Duck,"A slimmer fitting work-pant cut from a space-aged blend of hemp, organic cotton, recycled polyester, and smidgen of stretch. The cut is a little more tapered than the pants you’ll find at the hardware store, but the fabric’s just as tough, and the stretch lets you move around without worrying about a rip. It’s got those handy reinforced knees with none of the flashy rivets (we used heavy duty bar-tack stitching to reinforce stress points instead), so you can go from the workshop to a meeting without anyone giving you side-eye.","This is a custom-milled 12. oz kitchen sink canvas, and it’s got a little bit of everything in it. They’re mostly made of hemp, which is easy on the environment and lasts forever, but rough on the skin if they’re not blended with another fiber. To soften them up, we added a healthy dose of recycled polyester and organic cotton, and a little stretch so that we could cut them slim, and not have to worry about rips and tears when we bent over to pick something up."
The Camp Pant in Indigo Boss Duck,"The subdued ruggedness of The Camp Pant means it’s no more conspicuous in the boardroom than out in the field. The cut is a little more tapered than the pants you’ll find at the hardware store, but the fabric’s just as tough, and the stretch lets you move around without worrying about a rip. We nixed the flashy rivets (we used heavy duty bar-tack stitching to reinforce stress points instead), so you can go from the workshop to a meeting without anyone giving you side-eye.","This is a custom-milled 12. oz kitchen sink canvas, and it’s got a little bit of everything in it.

The Heavy Bag Waffle Long Sleeve in Navy,"When devising our Heavy Bag range, we had two goals: to offer a comfortable, sturdy option for people who need basics that don't run out of steam midway through the race, and to do so responsibly. The line has expanded since its humble origins, but the guiding philosophy remains intact, as evidenced by this exquisitely cozy waffle knit long sleeve—a no brainer base layer for any winter wardrobe. Take your marks, get set, and finish the race with style to spare. ","Not only is this custom seed stitch-style waffle knit incredibly comfortable, it's also made from Earth-friendly recycled and upcycled fibers, so you can keep feeling warm and fuzzy even after you take it off. "
The Wine Key in Brass,"This is our take on a clean and classic wine key. Whatever the occasion, you won't want to open another bottle without this trusty friend by your side.","Just like our our pocket knife, we crafted our wine key to take age with grace. Featuring a beautiful mix of stainless steel and solid brass, the exterior will show wear and usage, making each key distinct to its owner."
The Able Vest in Wool Beach Cloth,"A sleek reversible vest cut from a soft-blended wool that's both resilient and versatile. Seed stitched on one side, blanket-striped on the other. Milled with a custom-developed blend of virgin wool, cotton, and nylon for decades of softness and resilient fit. This warm, low-profile vest adds a dash of autumn cool when layered over a solid-colored button-up.","A cozy blend of virgin wool with nylon and cotton. One side of the fabric is seed-stitched, with tiny, subtle ridges.  The other side has horizontal blanket stripes with pouch pockets. This guy has nothing to do with the beach; rather, the name references the inventor’s name, who created this blended wool at the start of the 20th century. Nylon is a miracle fiber when it’s blended with wool. Not only does it add warmth, but it makes the sweater softer while adding loft and strength to the fibers for a cold weather essential that will keep it’s fit season after season, year after year."
The Explorer Shirt in Navy Boiled Wool,"If you’re the type of person who doesn’t mind getting lost once in a while, you understand the value of being equipped for the unexpected. True to its name, The Explorer Shirt was designed and built for journeys that lack sharply defined destinations or goals. Robust, versatile, and now available in a perennial navy colorway, The Explorer Shirt is the perfect companion to bring along whenever you’re charting new territory.","This timless navy-colored woolen blend is hefty, soft and supple, so it’ll keep you warm without restricting your movements. Featuring classic brass donut hole buttons and two front patch pockets, The Explorer is about as simple as it gets—we count that as one of its strengths."
The Winslow Parka in Mustard Waxed Canvas,"There’s nothing quite so satisfying as conquering the elements, which is why we put so much love and care into The Winslow Parka. From drizzles to downpours, The Winslow is the first thing you’ll reach for when the weatherman delivers the bad news. That said, it looks so damn good—especially in this striking mustard colorway—that we wouldn’t blame you for throwing it on even when the forecast is clear. Better safe than sorry, right? ","With some help from our good friends over at Halley Stevensons, this sturdy organic cotton canvas has been weatherproofed the old-fashioned way—with beeswax—giving it its unique appearance and texture. The Winslow Parka is also incredibly warm, thanks to a custom-developed blanket liner that’s guaranteed to keep you cozy and insulated from the elements. Pull the hood up and you’d be forgiven for thinking you’re already back inside sipping cocoa in front of the fire. "
The Lined Long Haul Jacket in Olive Waxed Canvas,"The Waxed Long Haul is a Taylor Stitch staple: a hard-wearing, weather-resistant everyday jacket in a timeless cut. This time around, we’ve given that classic formula a not-so-subtle upgrade with a cozy blanket lining and a beeswaxed finish courtesy of the industry legends at Halley Stevensons. Next time a big storm breaks, you won’t have to leave your favorite jacket at home—this Long Haul can take it. ","This 9-oz organic cotton canvas has been weatherproofed the old-fashioned way—with beeswax—giving it a fighting chance against the elements as well as a striking look and texture that will develop unique character as the wax works itself into the fibers. We’ve gone a step further and bolstered it with a 13-oz blanket liner that’s soft, cozy, and adds a nice amount of heft without slowing you down. Signature details like custom copper Taylor Stitch hardware and zigzag reinforcement stitching round out what promises to become your go-to jacket when it ships out this winter. "
The Moto Jacket in Loden Steerhide,"The story of our Leather Moto spans two generations and thousands of miles. Inspired by a vintage café-racer, we traced the original back to our neighbors at Golden Bear and commissioned a handsome, hardwearing recreation that will last generations. Leave your children a jacket to fight over.","This is a future heirloom. Take care of it, and it'll last a lifetime. The full-grain, drum-dyed steerhide will soften and patina beautifully with wear, while details like flannel-lined pockets and a Thinsulate™ layer will keep you comfortable no matter how you choose to break in your new jacket."
The Jack in Straw Everyday Oxford,"We like to think that after designing, building, and selling thousands upon thousands of Oxford shirts, we’ve more or less perfected the art. The Jack’s timeless styling speaks for itself—no bells and whistles necessary—and its construction and fit are second to none. We’ve added some pop of coloring this time around to keep things interesting, but otherwise, The Jack ain’t broke, so we’re content to let it be.","A spring-ready color with just the right amount of structure for year round wear. Soft to the touch but built for a decade of solid wear. Oxford is a perfectly versatile fabric that looks just as good pressed as it does pulled off the back of a chair. While traditional cotton uses 25 percent of the world's pesticides, our organic cotton doesn't use a drop. A better shirt, responsibly built for the long haul."
The Short Sleeve Jack in Indigo Star,"Our signature, short sleeve, slim-fitting button down cut from Japanese cotton oxford cloth. This iteration of the Jack comes in an indigo colorway with subtle star designs that add a slight visual pop to this standard, short-sleeve button-down. Great when the collar is peaking out from under a solid-colored sweater, or all on its own with a pair of jeans or trousers.","A lightweight, plain weave indigo-dyed cotton, milled in Japan. This fabric has a subtle discharge print ‘star’ design which complements the tonal variations of the box weave. Expect the base color to mellow out and lighten with years of wear and sun exposure."
The Heavy Bag Polo in Red Stripe,"The Heavy Bag Polo brings precision and weight to a classic category. Here, the perennial polo is recast in a clean-fitting, heavy cotton blend that refuses to lose its shape no matter how often you wash and wear it. Menswear icons from the 60's and 70's rocked the polo as a daily driver—bridging the gap between a casual tee and a button down. In light of that, we developed a slim fitting cut in three versatile colorways that even they would be proud of.","Even the best polos won’t last forever—they shrink in the wash and the collars tend to warp—that won’t happen with the Heavy Bag. Knit from a heavyweight blend of up-cycled cotton and recycled polyester, the cotton is collected from cutting room floors in the textile industry, which is shredded, cleaned, and woven into brand new fibers. The recycled polyester goes through a similar process, and eventually the two fibers are knit together to create a thick, substantial fabric, with a remarkably soft texture. "

The Short Sleeve Heavy Bag Henley in Cypress,"Cut from the same fan-favorite fabric found in The Heavy Bag Tee, our Short Sleeve Henleys are about twice the weight of a standard cotton t-shirt, but oh-so-very soft.

The Trail Short in Navy Slub Sateen,"A tailored classic short cut from a reverse sateen organic cotton. This rugged summer staple takes construction cues from vintage military pants, with two stitched-down front pockets (with reinforced bar-tack stitching), and two back patch pockets with button flaps. The perfect option for hitting the trail or hanging around the house.","A lightweight organic cotton in reverse sateen that gets softer every time you wash it. Organic cotton uses a fraction of the water and energy resources of the conventionally grown stuff, and doesn’t pollute waterways and ecosystems."
The Short Sleeve Jack in Green Madras,"Our signature, short sleeve, slim-fitting button down cut from organic cotton madras cloth. This lightweight iteration feels similar to linen or oxford cloth, but is slightly more structured and substantial. Shown here in a subtle plaid, this short sleeve shines when the collar is peaking out from under a solid-colored sweater, or all on its own with a pair of dark jeans or trousers.","This shirt is cut from lightweight organic cotton madras. Madras is a classic shirting material that came to prominence in the early 60’s at the height of Ivy league style. There’s a crispness to the fabric, not unlike linen or oxford cloth, and it breathes exceptionally well. The blue-green color-way is a subtle addition to a long legacy of timeless men’s style. Organic cotton uses a fraction of the water and energy resources of the conventionally grown stuff, and it’s just as soft."
The California in Khaki Herringbone,"It’s easy to get lost in the morass of shirting options, so we like to follow a few rules to cut out the riff raff: a great shirt should look fantastic, it should be comfortable and rugged enough to wear every single day, and it should be built responsibly. If you’re reading this, you probably have a similar set of expectations, and you’re in luck—The California checks those boxes and then some.","Herringbone is a zig-zag weave that falls within the twill family—you see it in mens jackets and classic workwear (particularly chore coats and coveralls). This lightweight iteration has been garment washed, lending the fabric a soft, lived-in feel. The classic coloring means this shirt will fit its way into your weekly rotation for years to come."
The Jack in Olive Slub Chambray,"Our signature slim-fitting button down cut from an organic cotton slub chambray. This is an ideal shirt for those who appreciate the crisp structure of a tailored oxford but are looking for an extra dose of texture. The Jack is built like a tank, with sturdy double-needle flat felled seams (the same construction you’ll find on a pair of jeans), and rugged horn buttons. ","A lightweight, organic cotton chambray with a subtle slub. This garment is cut from 99% organic cotton, which uses only a fraction of the water and energy resources of the conventionally grown stuff. The other 1% is polyester, which manifests in that white slub thread that traces its way through the fabric. The slub yarn offers a unique, tweed-like sophistication to this classic, utilitarian button down."
The Ojai Jacket in Indigo Herringbone,"The durability of a denim jacket with the timeless sophistication of a tweed blazer, this tailored herringbone jacket brings a subtle burst of texture to your daily uniform. We love chore coats for their endless versatility, and this style transforms from a functional work-bench jacket to an unstructured blazer with a quick splay of the collar.",There’s nothing quite like this mid-weight cotton herringbone. A subtle zig-zag pattern dappled with tiny ‘nep’ fibers (errant white threads) that bring depth and nuance to an age old design.

Sateen is in the twill family (like denim and khaki), but it’s quite a bit softer. The problem with sateen is that because of its long exposed fibers, the fabric tends to snag (particularly as a pair of trousers), so we reversed the fabric so that the soft ‘face’ of the fabric rests on your skin, and the more durable ‘self’ is on the outside. It’s complicated, but the end of the day, sateen is incredibly soft and sturdy."

Organic cotton uses a fraction of the water and energy resources of the conventionally grown stuff, and doesn’t pollute waterways and ecosystems. This particular fabric has a brushed finish, which means the cotton is grown, cut, processed, and milled into fabric, which then runs under a large rotating cylinder covered in thousands of tiny brushes that abrade the fibers without compromising their structural integrity.

The Après Hoodie in Olive Hemp Donegal,"An unconventional take on a classic hoodie. This cozy blend of hemp and recycled poly is soft brushed on the inside to buttery perfection with a two-way brass zipper that won’t bunch at the waist. The reinforced welt pockets require six separate sewing actions, as opposed to the 2 it normally takes to sew your average kangaroo pocket. Why’d we do it? Because it looks cleaner and it gave us a great excuse to use our favorite San Fransisco map pocketing.","A hearty knit blend of hemp and recycled poly. The inside is soft-brushed for a warm, cozy fleeced texture.

","Unlined suede is soft and easy to break in, and it’s as warm and insulating as the socks you wear with it. If you opt for a chunky camping sock in winter, they’ll stay cozy, but if you go for a thin dress sock or even no-shows in summer, they’ll never overheat, making them perfect for year-round wear. For this model, we opted for a weatherproof suede with a tight nap combined with a hearty Goodyear-welted sole. That means it’s going to take a lot of bad weather for your feet to get wet."
The California in Navy Plaid,"An office friendly button up cut from a lightweight linen-organic cotton blend. In the spirit of easy-going coastal style, we nixed all the fussy details of a dress shirt—no button down collar, no pleats—and we hemmed it to the perfect length to tuck in, or not. After that, we tightened up the fit, giving you room in the shoulders, and tapering it up towards the body; then we raised the arm hole to bring a hint of tailored sophistication to a laid-back button up.","A lightweight, organic cotton, linen blend. This is a plain weave, summer-weight fabric in a rich, navy color you can wear all year long. Linen has a tendency to wrinkle easily and get holes after extended wear, so we decided to bring organic cotton into the mix to strengthen the fabric and make it easier to wear day-to-day. Linen is easy to grow, and minimally processed, and organic cotton uses a fraction of the water and energy resources of the conventionally grown stuff."
The California in Natural Hemp,"An office friendly button up with a healthy dose of texture. From a distance it looks a lot like an oxford shirt but up close there’s a lot more going on. First off, we nixed all the fussy details of a dress shirt—no button down collar, no pleats—and we hemmed it to the perfect length to tuck in, or not. After that, we tightened up the fit, giving you room in the shoulders, and tapering it up towards the body; then we raised the arm hole to give it a hint of tailored sophistication. The fabric is a soft organic cotton hybrid with a natural slub that will add a nice textural pop to everything you wear it with.","A lightweight woven shirting hybrid with a mild slub texture. The majority of the blend is organic cotton, which requires only a fraction of the water of conventionally grown cotton. The rest is hemp and lyocell. Hemp is so robust and easy to grow it doesn’t need pesticides, and lyocell is a soft filament fiber derived from discarded wood scraps."
The Jack in Ash Hemp Melange,"Our signature, slim-fitting button down cut from a hemp-dominant, organic cotton blend. This particular iteration of the Jack comes in a natural, grey melange that pairs perfectly with any denim in your arsenal. ","A structured hemp-dominant, organic cotton melange. Melange is a woven fabric made up of tonally similar yarns (shades of white and black) that, from a distance, create grey. Hemp is a resilient, sturdy fabric that doesn’t need pesticides or much water, and organic cotton uses a fraction of the water and energy resources of conventionally grown stuff."
The Gibson Trouser in Navy,"Versatility in a spring-weight suit. Cut from a hearty blend of linen and organic cotton, the Gibson transitions seamlessly from the office to weddings, and even works weekends. The robust linen-organic cotton blend is soft to the touch, but easy to take care of when it gets dirty, and won’t get wrinkled when you pull it out of your pack.","A linen-dominant organic cotton blend. Cotton prevents the fabric from wrinkling, so you can pull it out from the bottom of your pack and wear it, sans iron. "

The Project Jacket in Olive Boss Duck,"A classic hunting-inspired chore coat built with the planet in mind. Cut from our signature Boss Duck blend, this jacket has all the function and durability of a hardware store chore coat, with none of the harsh by-products of conventionally grown cotton.","This jacket is cut from our proprietary feel-good blend of hemp, recycled poly, organic cotton, and a dash spandex, woven together, with warm organic cotton corduroy at the collar, cuffs, and inside pocket flaps. The hemp gives the jacket strength and structure, while the recycled polyester lightens things up and makes the overall jacket soft and sturdy. Organic cotton balances the rigidity of the hemp, and the spandex allowed us to eliminate the bulky shoulder construction you find on most chore coats without sacrificing any mobility in the arms."
The Gibson Jacket in Navy,"A spring-weight linen blazer built for life on the road. When you’re traveling, you want a jacket that’s light and chock full of pockets (we placed 5 pockets on this jacket, two of which have secure zippers for your wallet, phone, and passport). There’s a stylish throat latch for when the going gets chilly.","A linen-dominant organic cotton blend.

The Western Shirt in Washed Denim,"It’s impossible not to make a strong impression with The Western Shirt. Vintage-inspired details like angled chest pockets and contrast YKK snaps may summon images of smouldering sunsets over dusty trails, but thanks to its sophisticated cut and exquisite blend of cotton and linen selvage denim, this shirt feels just as at home in the big city as it is out on the range.","A light washed, mid-weight selvedge denim with a bronze ticker (you can see it on the side-seam gusset detail and inside placket). The denim is a linen-cotton blend that’s been stone washed, softening up the fibers without compromising the structure of the thread. The result is a miraculously soft, breathable denim that might find its way into your regular button-up rotation."
The Piston Jacket in Indigo Corduroy,"Inspired by a vintage FFA jacket our Product Designer, Nick purchased while back home in Texas, our new Piston Jacket takes on the classic Harrington silhouette, rendered in rich, organic cotton indigo corduroy. This cornerstone of old school cool comes with a two-way zipper so it never bunches up at your waist if you’re sitting down, driving, or flying for that matter. There’s leather detailing on the welt pockets, side pull tabs, and under the collar, perfect for turning up when the weather gets bad.","There’s not a lot of organic cotton corduroy floating around, and we’d never seen anyone make a jacket like this out of it.  Most corduroy you have to be pretty gentle with (and typically dry clean), but this jacket can take a beating without matting out. Similar to a great pair of jeans, the Piston's rich indigo coloring will fade beatifuly with each wear, meaning that each jacket will become distinctive to its owner. Next time someone asks what you do or where you've been, just point to your Piston and let the jacket tell the tale. "
The Crewneck in Natural Donegal Terry,"A tailored, mid-weight crew neck sweater, knit from a cozy blend of organic cotton and recycled polyester, loop back terry-cloth. The raglan sleeves are cut from the neck to below the armpit for maximum range of motion throughout the day. Both soft and insulating, this timeless terry fabric pairs with a wide array of other staples in your closet, making it a daily driver for years to come.","Cut from a 50%-50% blend of organic cotton and recycled polyester with a loop back French terry. A 50-50 blend gives you all the strength of organic cotton, with the warmth and softness of a recycled poly. Loop back French terry feels like an extremely soft towel on the inside and a ‘conventional’ sweatshirt on the outside. The looped fibers retain heat, but stay off the skin, so this style never gets too hot or uncomfortable."

The Ranch Boot in Coal Weatherproof Suede,"Laces—who needs them? Stay a step ahead of the rest with the Ranch Boot, the latest addition to the Taylor Stitch footwear family. Slip them on and kick start the day. Fully resoleable Goodyear welt construction gives you Alden-level quality at a fraction of the price. The buttery sheepskin lining and foam insole give them slipper-like comfort right out of the box.","Suede’s great—it’s soft and pliable, and the finish looks great—only problem is, it stains. Heck, the most famous song in the American rock canon heralds the vulnerability of suede shoes (blue ones, specifically). We like suede, and we’re practical, so we developed weatherproof suede. The leather has a very tight nap, and it’s tanned with oils that naturally repel water. A lot of suede out there you have to baby, dusting it off after each wear, whereas ours will take a beating without a sweat. So go ahead and step on these black suede shoes — they can take it."
The Sundown in Heather Grey,"A slim-fitting button-up cut from blended cotton. If you’re looking for a button up you can wear to work or throw in your pack and take out after a long commute, look no further. Featuring our signature Jack collar, this shirt is cut on our classic, slim block with a cropped length (for going untucked).","The lion’s share of this shirt is made from cotton. We added a 20% acrylic which prevents wrinkling, and a little bit of polyester to make the fabric even softer. The elbows are the first things to go on button ups, so we added a hint of stretch, so you can move around without worrying about a rip. Sounds complicated, but it all adds up to a really soft, durable shirt."
The Jack in British Khaki Waffle,"Our signature, slim-fitting button down cut from organic cotton waffle cloth. This particular iteration of the Jack shirt comes in a rich British Khaki color. It’s a bold, hearty hue that will offer a nice pop of texture, and play beautifully against a dark green jacket, or earth toned sweater.","This sturdy, organic cotton waffle weave has the double benefit of increased surface area, which keeps the wearer warm, while also keeping the fabric directly off the skin, which increases air circulation and keeps you from ever getting too hot. While this may look like the waffle-knit thermal you’d find at a surplus store, this is in fact a waffle weave, which means it won’t stretch out like a thermal. "
The Jack in Natural Waffle,"Our signature, slim-fitting button down cut from organic cotton waffle cloth. This particular iteration of the Jack shirt comes in a natural, un-dyed, ‘ecru’ color. For those of you who appreciate the subtleties of un-bleached cotton, this waffle-weave will add a dash of texture to any outfit that calls for a white collared shirt.","This sturdy, organic cotton waffle weave has the double benefit of increased surface area, which keeps the wearer warm, while also keeping the fabric directly off the skin, which increases air circulation and keeps you from ever getting too hot.

The Jack in Indigo Oxford,"We might source fresh materials every now and then, but don’t worry, The Jack you know and love remains the same as ever. It’s the perfect shirt for, well, just about anything—whether you’re debuting it at the office or at a dinner party, it’s sure to turn heads. And because it’s been built for the long haul, you’ll be keeping those heads turning for years to come.","Oxford will never go out of style: both resilient and beautifully textured, it’s earned a permanent spot on the TS roster. This particular Jack iteration comes in a rich indigo color that will mellow with extended sun exposure and repeated washes—so just like that 23 year old Kentucky Bourbon sitting in your cabinet, this shirt only gets better with age. It's also constructed with organic cotton, which is great because it uses a fraction of the water of conventionally grown stuff, and way less energy to process it."
The Welterweight Winslow in Field Tan Waxed Canvas,"Meet our newest iteration of the famed Winslow: a lighter take on our fan-favorite silhouette in a timeless field tan coloring. This midweight waxed canvas jacket was built to be worn year round. Oh, and did we mention? The Welterweight Winslow has enough pockets to carry all your daily essentials and is strong enough to keep the water and wind at bay.","A midweight cotton canvas with a water-resistant waxed finish developed in partnership with our friends at Halley Stevensons in the UK. You can’t add a wax treatment to any fabric and expect to make it water resistant. While the proprietary paraffin wax ‘seals the deal,’ water resistance starts with a tight box weave. The weave we developed for our Welterweight Winslow is so tight that it’s difficult to see with the naked eye."
The California in Caramel Plaid,"It’s easy to get lost in the morass of shirting options, so we like to follow a few rules to cut out the riff raff: a great shirt should look fantastic, it should be comfortable and rugged enough to wear every single day, and it should be built responsibly. If you’re reading this, you probably have a similar set of expectations, and you’re in luck—The California checks those boxes and then some.","This soft plaid shirt is cut from organic cotton woven into a herringbone pattern. More often you’ll see herringbone (those little undulating waves formed in the weave) on outerwear, particularly blazers and greatcoats. Lucky for us (and you), we have an outstanding relationship with our mill, and can make shirting-weight fabrics using outerwear motifs, all in organic cotton. The color too is pretty stupendous, with those subtle blues fraternizing with the classic caramel coloring. This would be a fantastic vintage find, and to have it made in 100% organic cotton only makes it that much more special."
The Heavy Bag Waffle Henley in Cardinal,"A contemporary call-back to the classic thermal henley, our take on this cold-weather staple is even warmer—and more rugged—than what you grew up with. When push comes to shove, and cold comes to really cold, you’ll be glad you’ve got the insulating peaks and valleys of The Heavy Bag Waffle Henley on hand. ","Not only is this heavy-duty waffle knit incredibly comfortable, but it's also made from 100% recycled materials, which means you'll keep feeling warm and fuzzy even after you take it off."
The Moto Boot in Black Waterproof Nubuck,"A sleek cap-toe boot cut from sturdy calf, mounted on a Goodyear-welted Vibram® sole. Handmade in León, Mexico, our Moto Boot boasts total durability and an effortless break-in, with a rugged double-leather cap toe. We opted for a contrast natural welt (the light strip of leather just north of the sole) which draws the eye from the cap-toe, through the exposed eyelets and up the leg: the result is a classic Moto Boot that makes you look taller off the bike.","This boot is cut from a lightweight, waterproof calf leather tanned for softness and flexibility right out of the box—no break-in required. Built using the same triple-needle lockstitch construction you’ll find on better overalls and chore coats, it’s fully lined in leather for a snug, comfortable fit. The Moto is mounted on a Goodyear welted sole, with a storm-welt construction that keeps out water. They’re easily re-soled, and the thin Vibram® lug offers comfort in every step."
The Heavy Bag Waffle Long Sleeve in Natural Archive,"When devising our Heavy Bag range, we had two goals: to offer a comfortable, sturdy option for people who need basics that don’t run out of steam midway through the race, and to do so responsibly. The line has expanded since its humble origins, but the guiding philosophy remains intact, as evidenced by this exquisitely cozy waffle knit long sleeve—a no brainer base layer for any winter wardrobe. Take your marks, get set, and finish the race with style to spare. ","Not only is this custom seed stitch-style waffle knit incredibly comfortable, it's also made from Earth-friendly recycled and upcycled fibers, so you can keep feeling warm and fuzzy even after you take it off."
The Crater Shirt in Green Plaid,"The Crater Shirt made a big impact upon its induction into the TS family, and now it’s finally back and better than ever. This mid-weight shirt features characteristically rugged construction and is heavily brushed inside and out for immediate and everlasting comfort. We designed it to be the best flannel you own—the kind of garment your buddies might tease you for wearing a little too often. Pay them no mind, though: they’re just jealous.","This 9-oz brushed flannel was custom developed for Taylor Stitch using 100% organic cotton. All of The Crater Shirt’s no-nonsense features return, including distinct styles for each chest pocket, classy cat eye buttons, and our versatile California collar. Now in a timeless green hue, you can happily rock this shirt while shedding some light during the colder months."
The Ojai Jacket in Shetland Moss,"A cold weather chore coat cut from performance-blended wool. This jacket is unlined, and meant to be worn as a top layer over a sweater or button-up. Drawing on a number of denim-inspired construction details, our Ojais include bar-tacked pockets (the very same stitch you’ll find holding the back pockets on a pair of jeans), and durable, double-needle stitching throughout.","Cut from 15-oz. performance-blended wool, this particular blend can be worn directly on the skin (say, if you wanted to put this jacket on over a t-shirt, your arms wouldn’t itch). There’s a little polyester in it, but polyester has a way of making great wool even better. For one, it makes wool fibers much softer, and far less itchy. This jacket will retain its shape over decades of wear, and this specific performance blend was specially developed to resist pilling. "
The Ojai Jacket in Navy Waffle Wool,"Featuring a ton of handy pockets and some rugged construction (including bar-tacked stress points), The Ojai is a serious piece of workwear that just so happens to clean up nice. Case in point: this brand new Navy Waffle Wool iteration, which is exceptionally cozy and boasts a waffled texture that looks awesome and provides extra insulation.

All of the style's signature details—including dual-entry front patch pockets and vintage-style ring-back buttons—return alongside some cozy Waffle texture, giving this update on The Ojai a unique finish that’ll look even better after it’s weathered some storms. "
The Cuyama Jacket in Cola Leather,"Keep your eyes on the future without losing sight of the past; it’s a model that’s worked well for us over the years, and one that informs The Cuyama Jacket down to the last stitch. Our lead designer, Nick Kemp, was inspired by a deep dive into the unsorted stock of a local vintage shop’s backroom, where he stumbled upon a gorgeous, well-loved leather jacket with detailing he’d never seen before, including a belted waist and uniquely shaped welt front pockets. He knew a one-of-a-kind garment like this deserved a life beyond the dusty old stockroom, so he decided to use it as a jumping-off point for this heirloom jacket. This isn’t just a simple recreation though—thoughtful updates are everywhere, including beautiful natural dark horn corozo buttons (complete with contrast reinforcement buttons), a cotton twill liner for added insulation, and corduroy detailing throughout. The Cuyama Jacket draws its inspiration from the past, but because it’s a Taylor Stitch piece, you can rest assured that it’ll live on well into the future.","This gorgeous 4-oz cowhide leather features a light brown pull-up that will emerge over time as it conforms to your shape. Beautiful right off the bat, and better with every single wear. Cotton twill lining throughout gives The Cuyama Jacket some extra heft, while natural horn corozo buttons and zig-zag collar stitching imbue this timeless garment with a distinctive character all its own."
The Jack in Charcoal Double Cloth,"Like all those holiday traditions you can’t help but indulge in year after year, The Jack is a classic that somehow never gets old. Featuring a tailored fit, an easygoing button-down collar, and peerless construction, this is one shirt you don’t have to think twice about—no matter the occasion. Wear it often, and in good health.","Double Cloth is precisely what it sounds like: two textiles woven together to increase durability and give distinct finishes to each side. In the case of our latest Jack, the result is rugged and texturally rich shirt that looks amazing when worn open to expose the contrasting color underneath. We’ve even added a touch of stretch to make sure this heavyweight doesn’t slow you down."
The Ojai Jacket in Windowpane Wool,"A cold weather coat cut from British waxed wool. The wool came from a centuries old mill called Abraham Moon, and was given a wax treatment at Halley Stevensons, a weather-proofing specialist in Scotland that’s just a few years younger than Abraham Moon. History aside, it’s a gorgeous coat. Check out that bias cut chest pocket, natural corozo ring-back buttons, and double entry pockets. The Ojai blends the best of British fabrics with all the utility of a modern field coat.","This 11 ounce waxed wool is woven at Abraham Moon & Sons, established in 1837. The fabric was finished over at Halley Stevensons, a wax and waterproofing specialist who originally started by waxing sales in 1864. 11 oz is a mid-weight wool. It’s plenty pliable, but it will still keep you warm and dry. The fabric contracts a lot during the dyeing process, so it’s naturally water-resistant and the wax treatment gives it a true water repellency."
The Bomber Jacket in Charcoal Wool,A real deal Bomber cut from performance-blended wool. A heavy duty navy ribbing at the collar and cuffs gives great balance to the slightly marled grey wool while the cut hits perfectly just below the belt line.,"A beefy, 15 ounce blended performance wool. This blend is composed of 80% wool, and 20% polyester, which makes the wool softer on the skin and gives it long term durability."
The Long Haul Jacket in Black Selvage,"A solid denim jacket cut from a 14 oz. organic selvage, engineered for daily wear. What’s that mean? Little things, and lots of them. Sloped patch pockets that your hands easily slide into, a pen slot, and our signature zig-zag stitch on the collar so it stays up when you need it to. Clean lines for getting dirty, that’s the Long Haul.","Our true black 14 oz organic cotton selvedge in a traditional 3x1 weave. There’s some tooth to this fabric, some grit, and we worked with our mill to get it just right. The warp and weft are dyed black, but you’ll get an ever-so-slightly grey cast on your falling warp threads with time and wear. The low tension, slubby texture of the denim is revered by denim aficionados the world over."
The Slim Jean in Black Selvage,"A mid-rise jean cut from a 14 oz. organic cotton selvedge. Fits slim in the thigh, down through the leg. We added some shape to the front rise so your ‘boys’ have some room to move.","True black 14 oz organic cotton selvedge in a traditional 3x1 weave.

The Vertical Jacket in Olive,"Tempted by the unparalleled insulation of a puffer jacket but leery of the sea of bland options? So were we, which is why we developed The Vertical Jacket, our take on the cold-weather staple that won’t give out after a single season. Built to survive the harshest conditions—whether as an underlayer or a standalone jacket—and to look good doing it, The Vertical Jacket stands tall in a class of its own. Onto the next summit. ","Constructed from a burly, water-repellent 4-oz. nylon (just over twice the weight of the industry norm), filled with recycled polyester, and quilted in a unique wave pattern to distribute warmth evenly, The Vertical Jacket is the last insulated jacket you'll ever need. We got tired of seeing flimsier alternatives buckle under pressure, so we set out to create a rugged, resilient, and overbuilt option that you can count on for many cold spells to come. "
The Monterey Bomber in Navy Wool,"This is a cropped winter Bomber cut from a hearty 24 oz felted British wool. The same wool that the Royal Air Force used for multiple centuries. The Monterey has a clean finished hem with a brass D-ring cinch to keep the wind at bay. Where traditional bombers ride up in the cuffs because of a lack of articulation in the shoulders, the Monterey is outfitted with a bi-swing back shoulder for total range of motion. This jacket is a celebration of spectacular wool, applied to a really ingenious Bomber pattern, that lends polish to a timeless, cold-weather staple.","The Brits know wool better than anybody, and this peacoat owes its luster to the famed Abraham Moon Mill that’s been operating in the United Kingdom since 1837. There’s a remarkable loft and structure to the wool. At 24 ounces the fabric is really substantial, but it still has a soft, buoyant quality. Comprised of over 170 years of textile tradition, it’s more than a coat, it’s a piece of history."
The California in Navy Salt and Pepper,"It’s easy to get lost in the morass of shirting options, so we like to follow a few rules to cut out the riff raff: a great shirt should look fantastic, it should be comfortable and rugged enough to wear every single day, and it should be built responsibly. If you’re reading this, you probably have a similar set of expectations, and you’re in luck—The California checks those boxes and then some.  ","This 8-oz organic cotton is perfect for cooler weather—hefty enough to keep you cozy as temperatures carry on their annual descent but still plenty breathable in case that guy at the office cranks the heater. This understated Navy Salt & Pepper colorway plays well with blazers, jackets, and coats, but offers more than enough of textural depth to stand on its own. "
The Explorer Shirt in Burgundy,"If you’re the type of person who doesn’t mind getting lost once in a while, you understand the value of being equipped for the unexpected.

Featuring a tailored fit, an easygoing button-down collar, and peerless construction, this is one shirt you don’t have to think twice about—no matter the occasion. Wear it often, and in good health.","The oxford weave will never go out of style: resilient, soft, and beautifully textured, it’s earned a permanent spot on the TS roster—and in the pantheon of style.

Give a feel and we guarantee you’ll be sold."
The Jack in Cinnamon Corduroy,"Like all those holiday traditions you can’t help but indulge in year after year, The Jack is a classic that somehow never gets old. Featuring a tailored fit, an easygoing button-down collar, and peerless construction, this is one shirt you don’t have to think twice about—no matter the occasion. Wear it often, and in good health.","This 8.5-oz organic cotton has a nice heft to it—just enough to keep you warm but still easy to layer under heavier garments. The structured feel of the corduroy will relax over time, giving this Jack a uniquely soft texture that gets better with each wear. This gorgeous Cinnamon colorway may be perfectly suited to the warm hues of fall, but it’s far too handsome to fade into the background. "

The Après Hoodie was designed to keep you cozy—and looking sharp—while you kick back and relish a day well spent. Go on, you earned it. ","Some things are just better in pairs: peanut butter and jelly, Lennon and McCartney, hemp and organic cotton. Right at the intersection between hemp’s durability and texture, and organic cotton’s natural softness and breathability, The Après Hoodie emerges as a contender for our favorite hoodie of all time. Fine leather detailing and an absurdly soft brushed fleece interior only serve to cement its spot at the top. "

The Camp Pant in British Khaki Moleskin,"We’ve given our Camp Pant a fresh coat of paint, but don’t let the refined finish scare you away. The fit and features remain the same, and the soft texture of the moleskin belies a garment that’s not only durable but also resistant to the elements.","Moleskin is a remarkably versatile fabric.

Though it packs the visual wallop of a heavy twill, it’s as soft and supple as can be—and quite cozy to boot. Just wait and see what they feel like after a couple of wears and washes… "
The Leeward Shirt in Chocolate Donegal,"To the seafaring among us, the term leeward will suggest protection from trade winds, but even those with a healthy fear of the open ocean can take shelter in our signature Leeward Shirt. True to its name, this sharp, versatile shirt is built to keep you warm and dry no matter the size of the storm. ","We hardly need to announce the fact that we’re big fans of the unique visual impact of donegal wool. Subtle and irregular flecks of color elevate this already gorgeous blend into something truly showstopping.

At the office or in the field, Whiskey Eagle soars above more one-dimensional leathers."
The Heavy Bag Hoodie in Heather Grey,"Ah, the pullover hoodie: a casual classic, perfectly suited to lounging, layering, and general cozy-keeping.

The Gibson Jacket in Charcoal,"Growing up, we learned that the key to travel is blending in. Each trip presents happenstance occurrences that are impossible to predict.

We channeled this mantra when designing The Gibson Jacket. ","Drawing inspiration from vintage, occasion-agnostic 3-roll, 2-button military jackets, the Gibson features extra buttons and a removable throat latch which allows it to be worn and styled depending on the circumstance.

The Heavy Bag Tee in Buen Dia,"We know as well as anybody how easy it is to get caught up in the rhythm of life.

Though its constituent features — wooden toggle fasteners (designed for ease of use while wearing gloves), roomy integrated hood, and buttonable neck strap — are instantly recognizable, there’s still something uniquely striking about this time-tested classic. We saw no reason to fuss with the fundamentals, and focused instead on refinement by way of superior materials coupled with Golden Bear’s peerless construction. Anything but precious, the fact that there will only be 100 in existence means the Tomales Duffel Coat will become a prized artifact of American Style.","Despite its smooth texture and fine appearance, melton wool is exceptionally hard-wearing and weather-resistant. The beautiful 24-oz melton we sourced for our Tomales Coat has been bolstered by a Thinsulate™ layer and a cotton/polyester lining for additional insulation, while leather accents reinforce the sleeves and welt pockets. As per tradition, natural wooden toggles run down the front of the jacket to offset the rich loden color of the wool. "

The Hyde in Charcoal Brushed Houndstooth,"Houndstooth first emerged in the 19th century as a favorite of Scottish shepherds. Luckily for the rest of us, it soon took the world by storm, first in the courts of the European aristocracy and later as a bold statement for adventurous designers around the globe. Today, we're thrilled to present our very own spin on this storied weave. Subtlety is hardly synonymous with houndstooth, but we love a challenge, so subtlety is exactly what we worked to achieve with our newest Hyde. Take a closer look, though, and you'll get a glimpse at a truly rich history.","Traditionally, houndstooth has often been associated with woolen outerwear, and as a result, may call to mind a scratchy, rigid texture -- not so here! We've used 100% organic cotton, and brushed it for softness, making this one of the most comfortable shirts on our roster. Wearability aside, this is a class act, featuring genuine pearl trocha buttons, a tidy french front, and a longer tail suitable for tucking. "
The Leeward Shirt in Navy Tartan,"To the seafaring among us, the term leeward will suggest protection from trade winds, but even those with a healthy fear of the open ocean can take shelter in our brand new Leeward shirt. True to its name, this sharp, versatile shirt is built to keep you warm and dry no matter the size of the storm. ","This special, wool-dominant blend is not only incredibly warm and insulating, but it's also been lightly brushed, giving it a soft, pleasantly textured finish. Add to that a striking navy tartan, and you have a shirt that looks great from afar and even better up close. "

Add to that the rich oxblood coloring, and you have a shirt that looks great from afar and even better up close."
The Rover Jacket in Charcoal Birdseye Waxed Wool,"To rove is to wander. Fittingly, we designed and constructed the Rover Jacket with exploration and discovery in mind. It’s built to be an everyday garment that accompanies you on everyday adventures, big and small. After a brief absence, this Taylor Stitch mainstay is back in a remarkably elegant birdseye wool. As has become Rover tradition, it’s been waxed for weather resistance, this time in collaboration with industry leaders Halley Stevensons in Scotland. One for the rover in all of us. ","Few can claim to have a broader understanding of wool than the folks at the Abraham Moon Mill, which has been operating in Guiseley, Leeds since 1837 (for those keeping track, that’s when Queen Victoria ascended the throne). In the intervening years, they’ve established themselves as one of the most widely respected manufacturers of fine wool fabrics on the planet. 100% Moon Wool, treated by the weatherproofing experts at Halley Stevensons, serves as the foundation of this UK-made jacket, while 10oz British black moleskin lining grants extra insulation and matte black grommet vents at the armpits allow air to flow. "
The California in Ash Windowpane,"The versatile California cut, newly offered in a classic navy/ash windowpane plaid is back, sitting cozily between dressy and casual. Whether your windows are rain-streaked, caked with snow, or cracked wide open to a crystal clear day, our newest California shirt is a perfect companion. ","Though this garment has a substantial, almost wool-like appearance, it's actually made of 100% organic cotton, which we've brushed on both sides for added softness inside and out. Throw in handy features like flap chest pockets and a pencil slot and you've got yourself a sharp, comfortable, and practical everyday shirt."
The California in Olive Hemp Chambray,An incredibly versatile and particularly comfortable everyday shirt—with a subtle texture and stylish color match buttons—this version of the California is the perfect option for any occasion from sun up to sun down.,"The addition of hemp—one of the planet’s toughest natural fibers—in our newest chambray provides superior body, strength, and abrasion resistance, while the organic cotton offers the ideal structure and softness. To top it all off, these two fibers save immense amounts of water and don’t use any chemicals or pesticides."
The Camp Pant in Bedford Corduroy,"Add a subtle hint of texture to your rotation without losing the durability you’ve come to expect from our Camp Pant. The lauded fit and styling return in an eye-catching (and resilient) Bedford Cord, just in case you needed more options.","Bedford Cord (distinct from, but similar to, corduroy) is a super durable fabric that has been a staple in the world of workwear for decades. The US Navy made frequent use of the weave (pairing it with a water-repellent cotton) in regulation flight jackets during the first half of the 20th century. This stuff is tough."
The Camp Pant in Navy Moleskin,"We’ve given our Camp Pant a fresh coat of paint, but don’t let the refined finish scare you away. The fit and styling remain the same, and the soft texture of the moleskin belies a garment that’s not only durable but also resistant to the elements.","Moleskin is a remarkably versatile fabric. Its soft texture and crisp appearance suggest luxury, but it’s actually been favored for centuries largely due to its durability, as well as its insulating and water repellent properties. This iteration of our Camp Pant will serve you just as well at the office or a dinner party as it will out in the field."
The Heavy Bag Waffle Henley in Cardinal,"A contemporary call-back to the classic thermal henley, our take on this cold-weather staple is a lot warmer and more rugged than what we had when we were kids. When your other shirts are on the ropes, the insulating peaks and valleys of The Heavy Bag Waffle Henley's waffle knit will keep you cozy. After all, cold weather is no reason to stay indoors.","Not only is this heavy-duty waffle knit incredibly comfortable, but it's also made from 100% recycled materials, which means you'll keep feeling warm and fuzzy even after you take it off."
The Democratic Jean in 3 Month Rinse Selvage,"Better denim, better jeans. After a year of development, we are proud to offer our very first 100% organic cotton selvage denim. Every step of our process— from growth to cultivation to construction—has been reconsidered and retooled to create a sustainably manufactured pair of jeans that look and feel amazing. Responsibly rebuilt from the ground up for the long haul.","We truly believe in the importance of responsible manufacturing, and this custom-made, 100% organic selvage denim is a testament to that.  We partnered with one of the most well-respected denim factories on the planet, SARP, and set out to create an unmatched product without sacrificing sustainability. Our friends at SARP have long been ahead of the curve in terms of both materials and manufacturing standards, which has earned them hard-won GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) and Nordic Swan Ecolabel certifications.

The Coit Jacket in Blackwatch Wool,"It's mid-November, the leaves are turned, and the days are shorter. The air is brisk and your body colder. There's something about a woolen outerwear piece that really jives our turkey at Taylor Stitch—you know, damn-near an actual wool blanket cut into a hardy piece of clothing. It's the kind of thing you throw on when you have zero patience for the bone-chill of a winter's night, when all that matters is your body's warmth and your head's set right. Now cut in a handsome Blackwatch Plaid, and you have all that in one of the most badass shirt jackets we've ever produced, one single garment staring at a solid twenty years of use.","Blackwatch Plaid and Wool. Handsome. Proper. Rugged. Refined. There are many reasons the two are a match made in textilic heaven. Adorning Scottish regiments since at least the early 18th century, the marriage of this fabled tartan with Caledonian wools served a very real purpose—both to combat the blustery climate found in the Bonnie North as well as reinforce tribal order. Weighing in at a burly 13-oz., the wool blend found in the Coit will be sure to combat blustery climates from Northern California to Northern Maine too. The tribalism we'll leave to you."
The Lodge Sweater in Cardinal,"Yakety Yak, this sweater won't talk back. Wear it through the winter, and countless years to come, and you won't hear a peep—not a loose thread or worn-through cuff. This incredibly effortless sweater is built specifically for the long haul.","Contrary to the harshness of the name, Yak is astoundingly soft; rivaled only by Cashmere in the ability make even the toughest of tough melt. We custom developed the Lodge Sweater's  25% Yak and 75% Merino Wool knit to keep things cozy during those bitter days spent huddled up in the cabin this fall and winter. "
The Vertical Jacket in Navy,"The Vertical Jacket is warm—really warm. Thanks to the custom developed recycled polyester filling, this jacket is perfect as a stand-alone cold weather barrier yet also tailored to sit under our outerwear and create the ultimate fortress for when that sou'easter starts howling.","Rugged, resilient, and overbuilt—this is the last insulated jacket you will ever need. We chose to construct the Vertical Jacket from a burly, water-repellant 4-oz. nylon fabric and recycled synthetic down filling because we were tired of seeing our friend's puffers failing after less than a year in rotation. At just over twice the fabric weight of the industry norm, we set out to build an insulation layer to withstand a decade or more of wear rather than break the next Eiger speed record."

Good luck wearing through the elbow of this.
The Chukka in Weatherproof Chocolate Suede,"These boots are the perfect blend of style, functionality and comfort. The traditional re-soleable goodyear welt construction gives you and Alden-level quality at a fraction of the price. The waterproof suede means you can beat the hell out of 'em and they'll keep looking better. The buttery sheepskin lining and foam insole give them Air-Max like comfort right out of the box, not like other boots.","Each Chukka (one shoe not the pair) is constructed from precisely twenty individual parts, and every part is produced to their own unique set of critical measurements. Each of those 20 bits is held together with no less than 1000 stitches (yeah, we counted them). It's a hands-on process to make a shoe like this but its the only way to guarantee the shoe is rebuildable and constructed for the long haul."
The Hardtack Sweater in Olive Cashmere Donegal,"There's no expiration on our Hardtack. Created to stand the test of time—from the everlasting, goes-with-everything demeanor, to the meticulous construction, down to the sheepskin elbow reinforcements. This handsome donegal-flecked sweater will beat the chill tomorrow the same as it will in 2028. Plus the cashmere yarns guarantee it's more comfortable than just about anything else you own...","Cashmere. Do we even need to say more? Probably not, but we have all this space. Cashmere comes from a very specific breed of goat. Not only is it finer, stronger, lighter, and softer, than sheep's wool, it's also three times more insulating. Warmer, more comfortable, and longer wearing—what's not to love?"
The Presidio Jacket in Cognac,If there is a single word that can define the care and precision that Golden Bear invests in each Taylor Stitch Jacket it would have to be scrupulous. The commitment to perfection collected from nearly a century of trial and error is revealed in each and every limited edition Presidio Jacket.

The Telegraph Trouser in Charcoal Herringbone,"Our idea of the perfect trouser—the Telegraph Trouser leaves no measurement unrefined or stitch unfinished (except the pant hem, of course). Easily worn alone or with its matching jacket, our goal was to build a comfortable-to-wear, goes-with-anything pant that is easily tailored and built for the long haul. It wasn't easy, but we guarantee the Telegraph Trouser checks all the right boxes.","We've taken all the class and elegance of a wool suit and modernized it with an easy-care, easy-wear custom fabric. The wool gives you the look and prestige of a classic suit, while the hint of polyester provides structure and strength to deliver a Jacket impervious to wear, right out of the closet or the suitcase.

This time we're offering our promise of responsibility in a custom, subtle-yet-confident Indigo Stripe. "
The Heavy Bag Tee in Black Melange,"We took the soft touch of your favorite decade-old tee, hit it with heavily-seeded texture, and beefed it up. Rugged, but with a gentler side, this heavyweight's sure to slide to the top of your tee rotation.","Utilizing upcycled and recycled yarns, which are shredded and respun, this is the first truly waterless fabric and emits only trace amounts of CO2. Hint: This tee shirt would take about 1,200 gallons of water to make conventionally."
The Heavy Bag Tee in Sea You Again,"We’re excited to introduce some very exclusive additions to our lineup of Heavy Bag Tees. Taking a cue from surf and sand, our Creative Director & co-founder Mike Armenta and close friend Ty Williams collaborated to design three graphic pocket tees just in time for summer.

The California in Olive Jacquard,"How many dots are there? From afar the detail of the dots is lost in the intriguing texture and refined silhouette, but upon closer inspection the true story of this shirt comes to life. There's more than meets the eye in this fan-favorite version of our California Shirt. We're so enamored with the jacquard weave that we are offering it in two brand new colors.","This custom developed fabric showcases the incredibly intricate nature of a true jacquard weave. In fact, Jacquard looms, designed in 1801, have been identified by IBM as one of the earliest forms of ""computer programming.""

The Utility Shirt in Charcoal Jacquard,"Fall weather clothing is all about versatility—a shirt should work just as well as a stand alone as it does in a layered ensemble.

Stuff it in your carry-on, leave it in the passenger seat, or hang it on the back of the door, this shirt is ready for fall foliage.","What does Jacquard mean anyway? Well, it’s a broad term and, in this context, isn’t unlike using the word ‘pastry’ to describe both a muffin and croissant. Sweet breakfast morsels aside, Jacquard is a woven technique in which both the warp and weft yarns move on independent heddels, allowing for thousands of different woven patterns.

The Long Haul Jacket in Indigo Waffle,"Not unlike Waffle House's All-Star Special, this Long Haul is a heavy hitting, clear the bases, rarity amongst traditional trucker jackets. Over time, the waffle knit fabric enables intricate fades due to the fabric's peaks and valleys. Indigo dye, like maple syrup, finds solace in the crevices, while exposing the raised threads to the elements and subjecting them to fading. Whether you prefer all-natural or Log Cabin, we can all agree that it's best to make room in the batting order for this Long Haul.","This indigo-dyed 100% cotton waffle woven fabric differentiates itself with a subtle suavity. Given the materials’ weight, we helped jumpstart the ‘breaking-in’ process by running it through a heavy stonewash; giving it the convenience of a ‘just-add-water’ waffle mix with the complexity and nuance of granny’s homemade buttermilk batter."
The Rangeley Sweater in Navy Cash Merino,"From dockside to mountainside to deskside, this finely crafted sweater is our take on the ever-classic and seasonless Nordic uniform. Because just as the glacier-carved fjords can create temperamental summer forecasts, our home on the Bay can similarly see all four seasons in a single summer day. We wanted to offer a layer fit for any season and any occasion, so don’t leave home without it.","Built from the finest wools.

The Democratic Jean in 24 Month Wash,"This stonewashed selvedge denim ensures a broken-in look and feel like two years of hard-worn fades. More Jobs than McQueen but equally equipped to push the envelope, they’re cut in our heralded Democratic fit and ready for the Wild West, Silicon Valley, and every frontier therewithin.","In 1891 brothers Moses and Ceasar Cone opened up shop in Greensboro, North Carolina to establish the legacy and expertise of American-made denim. Sadly, last fall marked the, now globally renowned, denim company's last year in operation and, with it, the end of all denim manufacturing in the United States.  While Cone will still continue their legacy of quality in their international mills, these jeans are some of the last of their kind. We have a limited stock of this storied fabric; these certainly won't last long."

The Jack in Charcoal Hemp Melange,"Melange is a fancy way of saying mixture. Sure, like many of our words it has its origins in French, but it's now very much in the English vernacular. So, voilà!",This melange fabric is a mixture of threads made entirely from responsibly-farmed hemp and organic cotton. Traditional cotton is responsible for 25% of the world's pesticide use—but you can rest assured we did our diligence to make sure this shirt doesn't use a drop.

The Gibson Jacket in Asphalt,"Growing up, we learned that the key to travel is blending in. Each trip presents happenstance occurrences that are impossible to predict. Whether you find yourself having dinner with foreign dignitaries, bar hopping with hostel buddies, or trying to impress a museum curator, your ability to succeed is contingent on two things: your suavity and outfit. We channeled this mantra when designing the Gibson Jacket. ","Drawing inspiration from vintage, occasion-agnostic 3-roll, 2-button military jackets, the Gibson features extra buttons and a removable throat latch allowing it to be worn and styled depending on the circumstance. With clean, sophisticated details, internal zippered passport pockets, and the ability to maintain shape while being packed and unpacked, the Gibson is everything we’d want in a travel companion."

The Jack in Navy Donegal,"“All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy” and a lifeless Jack is the last thing we want. The Jack in Navy Donegal introduces a compelling and tasteful aesthetic to our classic 3-button collar woven, making it truly the antithesis of “dull.” Equal parts conversation starter and show stopper, this shirt is utterly captivating without being flashy or braggy.","Donegal fabric is named after the place it’s manufactured, a town in Northwest Ireland where the textile style first originated. Given the area’s abundant sheep population, the Irish townsfolk began weaving signature twills, herringbone, and one-of-a-kind “flecked” woolen fabrics. This flecked style was popularized and ultimately named after the are from which it was born. In order to obtain this look, deliberate inconsistencies and blemishes are woven into the fabric. Yarns are purposefully knotted and broken, thus providing a “nep” effect. The result is a wonderfully speckled fabric with a unique hand and attractive aesthetic idiosyncrasies. Our modernized, 6 oz. donegal achieves ultimate comfort, drape, and durability through the use of an intricate cotton, silk, wool, and viscose blend."

So much so, we designed a pair of shorts just for these prized minutes.","What started out as a grounded, almost-too-stiff indigo crepe fabric really came to life after a watershed moment that brought out the personality lurking just beneath its surface.

The Short Sleeve California in Army Seersucker,"Seersucker's a funny thing. Sure, it brings to mind images of Twainian characters grandstandin' and politickin' throughout the American South at the turn of the century, but there's a sure reason it found popularity in those most hot and humid of American climes.

Wrinkles definitely included.","Developed during British imperialism in locales from India to the B.V.I., the light and airy quality to the seersucker weave makes for a fabric that lays away from the skin, allowing for greater air circulation when your body needs it most.

The Yuba Trunk in Yellow Print,"When the miles and wildflowers meander on, the ‘light at the end of the tunnel’ may come in the form of a swimming hole, waterfall, or snow run off-filled lake. The irresistible urge to jump in can only be stymied by cotton shorts or a hesitance of stripping down au natural. We stitched each pair of these summer-ready trunks with adventure in mind. From land to sea, mountain to lake, and wandering to wading, water awaits as soon as your shirt hits the ground.","Made from a 4.5 oz. DWR finished polyester and spandex blend, our Yuba shorts move with you, whether you’re in the water or on land.

With an obsessive attention to detail—ring-backed buttons, slanted side-entry pocket openings, organic double-sateen fabric, etc.—the Ojai is in a class of its own.","When we sourced sateen for the original Ojai, we were especially taken with the way it aged. After a few wears, its subtle sheen gave way to tremendous nuance in both texture and color.

It's lightweight enough to be worn under something heavier, but don't be surprised if you prefer to show it off."

The Easy Pant in Charcoal Herringbone,"Meet The Easy Pant, which borrows some ideas from the Après line (including peerless comfort and versatility) but sharpens things up with a brand new silhouette and a beautifully textured herringbone finish. We’d live in our sweats if we could, but until that day comes, dressing up just got a heck of a lot easier.","How do you strike the perfect balance between lazy-day comfort and big-event sophistication? With a blend, of course. We built The Easy Pant with linen, spun silk, and organic cotton, so it’s breathable, sturdy, and exquisitely soft. The Easy Pant can be hemmed to the perfect length, and we’ve created a tidy new silhouette that’s about as far from slouchy as they come. Lest you think we’ve gone full formalwear, we’ve equipped each pair with a handy internal drawcord and an elastic back waistband for maximum comfort and convenience."
The Apres Pant in Indigo Waffle,"Our ultra cozy Après Pant is back in some extra fresh colorways to keep you comfy all season long. Thanks to some sturdy construction and a tailored cut, our signature lounge pants aren't limited to lazy afternoons on the couch—whether you're heading to the beach, the grocery store, or your favorite lunch spot, they'll take you a good deal further than your average pair of sweats. ","There's something special about a well-executed waffle weave—the nuanced look, the awesome texture, and the way it gets better with every wash and wear. This mid-weight 100% organic cotton felt amazing straight from the mill, but we gave it a light wash to soften it up and really emphasize the peaks and valleys of the weave. Might as well get cozy—the season's only just beginning. "

The Wharf Pant in British Khaki Selvage,"The Wharf Pant in British Khaki Selvage is a new high water mark in the rugged and resilient category. Built from marine grade selvage boat canvas, which is naturally water resistant due to its tight weave, and outfitted with internally reinforced dual-layer knees and custom YKK hardware, The Wharf Pant is a battened down glutton for punishment that will be ready for the next voyage long after you’ve docked for the night. But that doesn’t mean we skimped in the looks department. With a roomy top box that tapers nicely down the leg and a medium rise waistband that’s shaped to lay flat against your back, these sea dogs can clean up nicely when paired with a collared shirt and a dress boot. We finished 'em off with a leather back patch and our signature SF map print pockets, because every detail matters. ","This boat canvas is made using an extremely tight “boat shrunk” weave that leaves it water resistant and less likely to fade over time. Selvage (as I’m sure you denim heads are aware) refers to cotton material that’s woven on old school shuttles, circling the weft threads back at the edge rather than cutting them, which can result in fraying. So then, what do you get when you make a selvage boat canvas? A material that’s tougher than a seasoned sailor and can outlive anything in your wardrobe; that’s what."

This classic Khaki Double Cloth iteration has been given a heavy garment wash for an ultra soft, broken-in feel right out of the box. ","This heavily textured Double Cloth is made (much as the name suggests) by stitching two layers of organic cotton together, resulting in a material with double the strength and a fraction of the environmental impact. With four pockets, a functional fly, and a handy drawcord waist, you’ll never have to sacrifice utility for the sake of comfort again."

The Democratic Foundation Pant in Organic Dark Navy,"Originally issued to American soldiers during WWII, the first military chinos were celebrated for their comfort, versatility, and impressive ruggedness. They proved so popular, in fact, that soldiers held onto their well-worn pairs even after discharge, and as more and more civilians took notice, the style became a fixture of garages and workshops as well as college campuses and city streets all across the country. Featuring 100% Responsible materials and an updated silhouette, The Foundation Pant is both a reinvention of our earlier chinos and an elevated reimagining of the all-purpose originals, built to help you start your day on solid ground.","The Foundation Pant project started when we discovered some deadstock military chino material and decided to reverse engineer it with 100% organic cotton. We chose a balanced weight (8-oz.) that feels great all year round, and opted for a tight weave using mercerized yarns, giving The Foundation Pant a smooth hand feel and improved durability. Because it’s been garment dyed and washed, it has the character of a well-loved vintage piece, and it’ll continue to pick up a ton of nuance with wear. 4-hole vintage military style buttons at the waistband serve as a nod to The Foundation Pants infantry origins."

The Foundation Short in Natural Twill,"We took our beloved silhouette inspired by WWII military chinos and lopped off the legs—what’s left may just be our favorite set of shorts to date.

The Heavy Bag Polo in Ocean,"The Heavy Bag Polo brings precision and weight to a classic category. Here, the perennial polo is recast in a clean-fitting, heavy cotton blend that refuses to lose its shape no matter how often you wash and wear it. Menswear icons from the ‘60s and ‘70s rocked the polo as a daily driver—bridging the gap between a casual tee and a button down. In light of that, we developed a slim fitting cut in four new versatile colorways that even they would be proud of.","Even the best polos won’t last forever—they shrink in the wash and the collars tend to warp—but that won’t happen with the Heavy Bag. Knit from a heavyweight blend of upcycled cotton and recycled polyester, the cotton is collected from cutting room floors in the textile industry, which is shredded, cleaned, and woven into brand new fibers. The recycled polyester goes through a similar process, and eventually the two fibers are knit together to create a thick, substantial fabric, with a remarkably soft texture."

The Heavy Bag Polo in Apricot,"The Heavy Bag Polo brings precision and weight to a classic category. Here, the perennial polo is recast in a clean-fitting, heavy cotton blend that refuses to lose its shape no matter how often you wash and wear it.

In light of that, we developed a slim fitting cut in four new versatile colorways that even they would be proud of.","Even the best polos won’t last forever—they shrink in the wash and the collars tend to warp—but that won’t happen with the Heavy Bag. Knit from a heavyweight blend of upcycled cotton and recycled polyester, the cotton is collected from cutting room floors in the textile industry, which is shredded, cleaned, and woven into brand new fibers. The recycled polyester goes through a similar process, and eventually the two fibers are knit together to create a thick, substantial fabric, with a remarkably soft texture."

The Heavy Bag Henley in Natural,"Cut from the same fan-favorite fabric found in The Heavy Bag Tee, our Henley’s about twice the weight of a standard cotton t-shirt, but oh-so-very soft. Imagine a heavyweight boxing champion holding a kitten; it’s a lot like that.","Utilizing upcycled and recycled yarns, which are shredded and respun, this is the first truly waterless fabric and emits only trace amounts of CO2.

So wear it hard and wear it often, the Long Haul will just keep getting better.

That’s why we’ve gone the extra mile and used 100% organic cotton in the construction of the Long Haul jacket. It’s everything you love about traditional selvage denim (hard wearing durability and an inimitable character) without the hefty toll on the environment.

The Ojai Jacket in Arid Camo Dry Wax,"If you’re a fan of the Ojai, you’ll be glad to know that we’ve been busy concocting all kinds of killer potential colorways for this absurdly versatile jacket. All of the obsessively curated details of the original are back, including dual-entry front patch pockets and rarely-seen ring-back buttons. Oh, and if you were waiting for a camouflage pun, all we’ll say is… don’t miss it.","The legendary purveyors of waxed and weatherproofed fabrics at Halley Stevensons developed this stunning Arid Camo exclusively for us, and we couldn’t be happier. At 9oz, it’s our burliest Ojai yet, and it’s also been dry waxed for added protection against the elements."
The Hangar Jacket in Espresso,"The boxy, bulky cuts characteristic of vintage flight jackets certainly have their charms, but in our opinion, the silhouette was overdue for an update. The Hangar Jacket takes many of its design cues from the classics—note the articulated shoulders and storm flap along the front—but we’ve elevated it (get it?) with a modernized fit, some seriously rugged construction, and an exquisite Espresso leather finish. This one’s built to last for generations—be sure it sees plenty of action before you pass it on. ","This 3-oz. Espresso leather boasts some incredible character and coloring that’ll become even more nuanced with age. We’ve insulated The Hangar Jacket’s torso with soft cotton twill for a little extra heft and equipped its sleeves with a smooth viscose lining for comfortable layering.

Don’t let the laid back looks fool you, though—The Ojai was made to be put to work, and it’ll only get softer the harder it’s handled. ","Hemp is a humble crop with some impressive credentials. It requires barely any water to thrive, produces the longest, strongest natural fibers known to man, and actively absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere—making it a carbon negative resource. It’s no wonder why we felt an immediate affinity for the stuff, and when you try on The Ojai in Rust or Espresso Hemp for the first time, we think you’ll feel it too."
The Dispatch Jacket in Natural,"Some styles just speak for themselves.

You’ll recognize those copper tack buttons and iconic front pleats from the pages of historical Americana, but the top flight tailoring and Responsible organic cotton are as up to date as they come. Rugged, Responsible, and in style for 80 years runnin’, The Dispatch Jacket in Natural is a big 10:4. ","This mid-weight organic cotton twill is so beautiful, we just couldn’t bring ourselves to dip it in colorful dyes. Years down the line, when you’ve laid a roadmap of hard work and adventure into it, we think you’ll agree—there’s no color in the world with the kind of character it’ll pick up on its own. Double-needle felled construction and our customary commitment to quality craftsmanship means this puppy will keep on truckin’ from the first wash and wear to the five-hundredth. "
The Ojai Jacket in Washed Indigo Sashiko,"At the intersection of art and utility, you’ll find The Ojai Jacket in Washed Indigo Sashiko. Not only does the traditional Japanese Sashiko stitch pattern beautify The Ojai, it bolsters it; adding additional durability from within. It’s a technique that’s been in practice for over four hundred years, and its distinctive interplay of indigo and white will fade beautifully as you carry on that tradition for some years of your own.

Just try not to let all the new attention distract you from the task at hand, this piece was made to work, after all.","Coming into practice in Japan as far back as the 1600s, sashiko embroidery was originally applied to clothing out of a practical need, strengthening the homespun clothes of olden times. The Ojai Jacket in Washed Indigo Sashiko builds on that heritage by using 100% organic cotton and Responsible materials throughout.  At 9-oz, it’s the perfect weight to throw over a t-shirt in the warmer months, or use as a mid-layer when winter rolls in, so it’s likely to stay in your heavy rotation season after season. Sturdy double needle felled construction and bar tack reinforcement on every pocket ensures it’ll still be your daily driver when those seasons turn to decades. "
The Ranger Shirt in Golden State,"Few things get our blood pumping like hitting the road and exploring new places, but no matter how far we travel, we’re always grateful to call California home. To pay proper tribute to our beautiful, sprawling, one-of-a-kind state, we’ve teamed up with the American icons at Pendleton Woolen Mills to develop The Ranger Shirt. Cut and sewn right here in California with a heavy-duty, USA-woven woolen blend (the kind that made Pendleton famous), The Ranger is a no-brainer for anybody with a taste for handsome, hard-wearing shirting. If that describes you, act fast—quantities are limited. ","Weighing in at 16-oz., this blend of wool and cotton is no pushover, but it’s got a soft, inviting texture that won’t irritate your skin. We’ve kept The Ranger Shirt simple with our easygoing California collar and two button-through flap pockets on the chest to really let the material shine. This Yosemite-inspired landscape pattern—which we call Golden State—was custom developed in cahoots with Pendleton and woven right here in the USA."
The Watts Jacket in Canary,"Our Watts Jacket is an all-season layering piece that’s designed to lock out the elements without weighing you down. Wet weather is a worry of the past thanks to the dry waxed organic cotton shell, and the cotton lining (also 100% organic) is light enough for warm weather but soft enough to keep you cozy when the mercury drops. It’s loaded with functional features like under-arm eyelets for extra breathability and a buttoned storm flap to keep those bitter winds at bay. This handsome Canary colorway sports a herringbone texture that will develop some killer character as the years take their toll. ","Dry waxing is a natural weatherproofing method with deep roots in menswear history. We’ve taken that time-tested practice and applied it to a Responsible, 100% organic cotton material that’s as timely as they come.

The Ojai Jacket in Sawyer Wash Selvage,"The Ojai Jacket is our take on the classic French work coat, and this iteration is about as true to form as they come. The 12-oz selvage denim is woven on old-school shuttle looms for some pronounced texture in the warp and weft and the heavy stone wash will yield some killer fades as you put it through its paces. Don’t let the effortless good looks fool you, with bar-tack reinforcement at every stress point and a slew of useful pockets,  the Ojai is as work-ready as they come.","As you put the Ojai Jacket to work over the years, the deep indigo dye will break away and reveal the undyed core of the warp and weft yarns, yielding some killer fades that are as unique to you as the lines on your hands. And because we’ve used 100% organic cotton, the ethics of its construction are as future-proof as its timeless styling. Finished with vintage-style tin tack buttons and a heavy stone wash for a soft, broken-in feel right off the rack."
The Workhorse Jacket in Marlowe Wash Denim,"True to its name, our Workhorse Jacket is built to conquer your to-do list and come back ready for more.

Wear it hard and rough it up, that’s what the Workhorse was made for.","From collar to cuffs, and everywhere in between, the Workhorse Jacket in Marlowe Wash is ready-built for a day on the job, and since the blanket stripe lining, corduroy detailing, and 12-oz selvage denim shell are all made from 100% organic cotton, it’s as Responsible as it is hard working.

With an Ideal zipper, best in class craftsmanship, and tough-as-nails snaps at the storm front and cuffs, The Workhorse has the longevity to stay in your heavy rotation long after the rest of your workwear has gone into retirement. "
The Western Shirt in Espresso Suede,"Generations of musicians have embraced the classic western shirt, and it’s not hard to see why: with its bold character and distinctive details, the style has a natural flair for showmanship.

The Western Shirt in Rust Pincord,"Our signature Western Shirt hits the trail once again—this time in a handsome, vintage-inspired Pincord finish to help you add some eye-catching texture to your shirting selection. Rugged construction (including bar-tack reinforcements at stress points), authentic details like slanted chest pockets and western-style front and back yokes, and a modern, tailored fit combine to create a shirt that feels old school without living in the past. Responsibly Built—and ready to ride—For the Long Haul.","At 4.5-oz., this organic cotton Pincord (also known as “pinwale”—essentially a very, very fine corduroy) is lightweight, breathable and boasts a ton of rich texture. Corduroy can occasionally have a rough, rigid texture, but we’ve given this batch a wash to soften it up and enhance its vintage vibe. Per tradition, this run of The Western Shirt features genuine YKK western snaps (including snazzy antique brass settings) and an awesome concho at the top of the front placket for a little extra visual impact. "
The Decker Jacket in Charcoal Quilt,"The first Decker Jacket was a faithful recreation of a rare vintage piece that our co-founder Michael discovered in a seaside workshop on his family’s property in Maine. Since we hit the history books for inspiration last time, we decided to take the newest iteration to the space age. The Decker Jacket in Charcoal Quilt looks as timeless as ever, but we opted for modern materials with an eye towards performance and Responsibility. The result is a streamlined take on a classic silhouette, brimming with features and Built for the Long Haul. ","Nylon is famously durable, but unfortunately, like so many fibers, its production takes a serious toll on the environment. That’s why both the shell and the lining of The Decker Jacket are built with recycled nylon, which is significantly easier on the planet—not to mention our conscience! We’ve insulated it with 100% recycled polyester for some extra warmth that won’t weigh you down, and finished the package off with classic YKK snaps. "
The Slim Foundation Pant in Olive Cord,"The original Foundation Pant was a callback to classic military chinos, pairing a fine-tuned fit and rugged construction with a faithful recreation of a robust, do-anything fabric. This time around, while the silhouette and its features remain the same, we’ve switched up the material for some vintage-flavored mid-weight crepe corduroy. This edition of The Foundation Pant is perfect for fall, but let’s face it—extra texture goes a long way all year round. ","At 9-oz., this organic cotton crepe corduroy is a tad heftier than the original Foundation Pant, but it’s still a nice, balanced weight that’ll keep you comfortable throughout the calendar year. We’ve added the slightest touch of stretch for extra flexibility and given the whole garment a wash to soften it up and enhance its rich texture. "
The Sullivan Slipper,"Fans of our footwear have been asking us to expand the range for ages, so we teamed up with the experts at Quoddy to develop The Sullivan Slipper. Built to the same specifications as their signature Grizzly Moc silhouette, The Sullivan is an ultra comfortable elevation of the classic moccasin formula, constructed with soft, supple waxed suede and a durable, hand-sewn Vibram sole. This piece is fully resoleable and—as always—Built For The Long Haul, so don’t be afraid to take it off-road. ","Suede has a notoriously patchy relationship with the elements, but we’ve solved the problem by waxing this batch to create a waterproof seal—no stains, no seepage, just the inimitable look of premium suede. We’ve equipped The Sullivan Slipper with an absurdly soft shearling lining and a fully functional perimeter lace (made with sturdy rawhide) to ensure a snug fit that’s easy to adjust. Built by hand in Maine; only 100 pairs available. "
The Lined Long Haul Jacket in Green Cast Denim,"The Long Haul needs no introduction, but this time around we’ve beefed up our signature denim trucker jacket with a cozy 11-oz. sherpa lining to keep you cozy throughout the cold season. The timeless styling and cut are the same as ever, but this time around we’ve adopted a special dyeing process that introduces a slight greenish hue that deepens over time as the indigo fades. Acetate-lined sleeves allow for easy, friction-free movement. ","This 100% organic cotton denim weighs in at 15-oz, making it a touch heavier than our typical denim offerings—and a perfect fall/winter companion, especially with the cozy sherpa lining. The slubby, low-tension weave feels fantastic on the first wear and even better after a year or two. As its name suggests, Green Cast Denim features a uniquely greenish undertone that reveals itself gradually over time. If your jacket collection is starting to look a little humdrum, why not go green? "
The Dispatch Jacket in Black 3-Month Wash Selvage,"The Dispatch Jacket takes much of what makes pre-1960s trucker jackets so beloved—especially the awesome pleated detailing along the chest—and modernizes it with a refined fit and rugged, Responsible materials. This time around, we built the silhouette with heavy-duty organic cotton selvage denim and gave it a thorough wash to achieve a soft, lived-in feel. It’s got all of the charm of a well-loved vintage piece, but we’re betting it’ll feel even nicer after it’s been in your rotation for a couple of months. ","We built this iteration of The Dispatch Jacket with 13-oz. organic cotton—just as versatile as conventional cotton, but a heck of a lot easier on the environment. New coat of paint aside, the features that define the silhouette—including its pleated front, custom donut hole buttons, and cozy hand warmer pockets—are back in action here, but we’ve given the whole package a wash to improve its texture. "
The Merino Henley in Heather Grey,"With its remarkable comfort and versatility, the original Merino Tee remains one of the most beloved styles on our roster to this day. The Merino Henley retains all of the incredible qualities of its short-sleeved predecessor—the luxurious texture, the performance features, and the perfected fit—in a fresh silhouette. It may look like a classic, but try one on for size and you’ll soon discover that this is a far cry from your average henley. ","Because it’s built with merino wool, The Merino Henley packs some pretty incredible features under its hood: it wicks moisture, it regulates body temperature, it's anti-microbial and stain-resistant, and it offers UV protection! The mercerization process bolsters The Merino Henley’s durability, renders it machine-washable, improves its drape, makes for a more vibrant, lustrous look, and gives it some cashmere-like softness that feels amazing against the skin.

The Heavy Bag Waffle Henley in Navy,"The history of the Henley goes back over two hundred years, when rowers competing in the famous Henley Royal Regatta found that the collarless, fitted design was a perfect companion during long hours of high-intensity exertion. We honored that history with a vintage style “seed stitch” construction and a tailored fit, then brought it into the modern age by using upcycled cotton and recycled polyester, adding ribbing at the collar and hem, and outfitting the classic half-placket front with some handsome cat's eye buttons. Whether you use it as a functional base layer or flaunt it on its own, The Heavy Bag Waffle Henley is at your service, For The Long Haul.","The traditional thermal “seed stitch” is about as functional as it gets, allowing for excellent breathability while still offering some killer insulation when the weather takes a nosedive. And by using 100% upcycled or recycled yarns, we dramatically reduce the amount of water that goes into production—for example, it takes nearly 1,200 gallons of water to manufacture traditionally. We’ve built The Heavy Bag Waffle Henley to be every bit as rugged as it is Responsible, so it will be at the top of your roster for years to come."
The Quilted Bomber Jacket in Espresso,"We’re teaming up with our buddies at Halley Stevensons to bring you a Responsibly Built take on a timeless classic.

It’s a rugged, feature-rich garment that’ll complement just about everything in your closet—and that goes for ten years from now, too. ","The Quilted Bomber’s shell is built with 6-oz. organic cotton that’s been dry waxed by the industry legends at Halley Stevensons—they’ve been in this game for more than 150 years, and it shows. The insulation and lining are both made with recycled materials, so you can stay cozy and be proud of the fact that you’re protecting the planet. Contrast ribbing at the collar and cuffs lend The Quilted Bomber some extra visual impact, and a slew of handy pockets mean you’ll never have to leave your essentials at home. "
The Western Shirt in Better Together,"Generations of musicians have embraced the classic western shirt, and it’s not hard to see why: with its bold character and distinctive details, the style has a natural flair for showmanship. That’s why we didn’t think twice about including our very own Western Shirt in The Better Together Capsule, which we developed in cahoots with rockers Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats. This edition features some killer chainstitch embroidery—the name of the collaboration on the front, and a striking floral design on the back. ","This edition of The Western Shirt is built with 100% organic cotton and features some awesome contrast chainstitch detailing alongside signature accents like genuine YKK snaps, bar-tack reinforcements throughout, and an antique brass concho-style top button. A portion of the proceeds from each piece sold will be donated to Nathaniel Rateliff’s charitable organization, The Marigold Project. "

The Jack in Coal Herringbone Check,"Momma always said, “If it ain't broke, don’t fix it”. That pretty much sums up how we feel about the shirt that started it all for us. We designed The Jack with the sole aim of creating the best shirt a guy can get, and though we’ve made some minor tweaks over the years (like switching to a more responsible 100% organic cotton) we’ve left the core elements of The Jack virtually untouched. This iteration sports a contrasty Coal Check that pairs perfectly with the double stitched dark horn buttons and a Herringbone weave that will pick up some killer character over time. Yeah, it’s a gorgeous new look, but it’s the same old Jack. Because Momma was right. ","Our responsibly sourced 100% organic cotton retains all of the benefits of regular cotton (moisture wicking, temperature regulation and durability) without the hefty environmental impact. We take that responsibility one step further by building The Jack with double-needle felled construction so it stays in your wardrobe and out of a landfill, year after year. "

The Short Sleeve Jack in Deep Navy Geo,"We designed The Short Sleeve Jack to be a summer-ready staple with all of the hard wearing features that made the original a true TS legend. So when we got the opportunity to team up with Brooklyn-based shibori artist Teresa Misagal of Dailola, we knew it was the perfect canvas for her to work her magic with—and the results speak for themselves. The subtle intricacies of this shibori pattern showcase both the rich history of this ancient artform and the stunning talents of Teresa herself. Though The Short Sleeve Jack in Deep Navy Geo is undoubtedly a work of art, it's built for hard work and will fade beautifully the more you get out there and show it off. ","Teresa Misagal is one of the most talented and inspiring dye artists we’ve come across, so we were absolutely thrilled to have the opportunity to work with her when we set out to create this capsule.

Her artful intention is on full display in the eye-catching pattern, harkening back to the roots of this traditional Japanese artform while reimagining it for a modern age.

The Jack in Navy Herringbone,"Momma always said, “If it ain't broke, don’t fix it”. That pretty much sums up how we feel about the shirt that started it all for us. We designed The Jack with the sole aim of creating the best shirt a guy can get, and though we’ve made some minor tweaks over the years (like switching to a more responsible 100% organic cotton) we’ve left the core elements of The Jack virtually untouched.

The Slim Jean in Natural Indigo Selvage,"Our Slim Jeans in Natural Indigo Selvage are made right here in the USA by skilled craftsmen using the highest quality materials out there. Rather than relying on more popular synthetic dyes, each fiber is dipped in natural indigo and quickly withdrawn, leaving the interior of the yarn white while the outside of it takes on that beautiful blue hue. As that indigo cracks and breaks away from daily wear (and trust us, you’ll want to wear them daily), the undyed core will become exposed, creating a fade pattern that tells a story all your own. We hope it’s a wild one. ","Indigo is one of the world’s oldest dyestuffs, with traces of it showing up in 4,000 year old Egyptian textiles. On top of being a natural stand-in for synthetic dyes, this indigo will yield highly dimensional fades the likes of which a lesser denim could only dream of. We’ve outfitted The Slim Jean in Natural Indigo Selvage with our signature map print pocketing and custom YKK hardware that's built to last a lifetime making these your new all around daily driver that’s well equipped to wear in, not out."

The Hugo Sweater in Navy,"Built for style and comfort through multiple seasons, The Hugo Sweater stays at the front of our wardrobes all year long. But where this mid-weight workhorse really shines is in the texture department. Utilizing a mixed stitch construction that alternates between a racking and rib weave yields dimensional texture that’s rich in the hand and easy on the eyes.

Layer it up or rock it solo, The Hugo handles it all. ","We teamed up with the Better Cotton Initiative to source some of the cleanest, most Responsible cotton out there, then wove it into a finer 7 gauge yarn to keep the silhouette on The Hugo trim enough for easy layering. While we’ve opted for a slightly lighter garment weight (especially compared to it’s burlier TS brethren), the combination of cotton’s natural temperature regulating capabilities and the old world technique of a tight seed stitch and heftier racking stitch means The Hugo works as a functional insulating layer while being light enough to sport solo in the warmer months.

The Point Shirt in Rain Drop Camo,"Our take on the classic military field shirt leans on meticulous craftsmanship and handsome tailoring, not bells and whistles. Meet The Point Shirt in Rain Drop Camo; a timeless silhouette featuring historically accurate details such as dual patch front pockets and vintage melamine style buttons, with major updates in the looks department. This 100% organic cotton ripstop fabric will wear in and soften over time, while the understated Rain Drop Camo pattern continues turning heads. Eye catching and easy to wear, The Point Shirt is our battle buddy of choice, season after season. ","Originally invented during the second world war to prevent tears in allied parachutes, ripstop fabric lives up to its name with a tight, uniform weave that included heavier weft yarns at regular intervals, effectively halting potential tears in their tracks. Sure, there’s a ton of technical benefits, but we think the look and texture are a real thing of beauty. And since we’ve used a water-saving 100% organic cotton to construct it, The Point Shirt in Rain Drop Camo is a Responsible recruit that you’ll want to have with you, no matter the day's objective. "
The Carpenter Pant in Cedar Boss Duck,"Designed in collaboration with Ron Finley as part of our Digging In Capsule, The Carpenter Pant in Cedar Boss Duck may just be the only pant as resilient and work-ready as Finley himself. And trust us, that’s saying something. They’re constructed from a Responsible, ultra-tough Boss Duck canvas specially developed for Taylor Stitch with hemp, organic cotton, recycled polyester, and just a touch of spandex for stretch, giving you an impervious pant tailor-made to take a lickin’ and keep on kickin’. Speaking of which, the hem openings are reinforced with kick panels to keep your cuffs from fraying.  We’ve also added interior reinforcement to the knees and bar tack reinforcements on the front and back pockets. Excessive? Maybe, but then again, it’s better to have it and not need it than, well… you know how it goes. To top it all off, you’ve got extra tool pockets, an added coin pocket, a back pen pocket, and a hammer loop—your toolbox never looked so good. This classic Cedar Boss Duck colorway has been given a Heavy stonewash for a broken-in feel that’s ready to work right out of the box. ","This specially developed Boss Duck material is a true marvel in the realm of Responsible workwear. It strikes the perfect balance of hemp, recycled polyester, organic cotton, and just a touch of stretch, making it one of the toughest materials we’ve ever used while also being one of the most Responsible. Since Ron Finley is nothing if not tough and Responsible, we knew it would be a perfect fit for the Digging In capsule. It’s a veritable workwear swiss army knife that’s finished with custom YKK hardware built to last a lifetime. "
The Democratic Jean in Natural Indigo Selvage,"Our Democratic Jeans in Natural Indigo Selvage are made right here in the USA by skilled craftsmen using the highest quality materials out there. Rather than relying on more popular synthetic dyes, each fiber is dipped in natural indigo and quickly withdrawn, leaving the interior of the yarn white while the outside of it takes on that beautiful blue hue. As that indigo cracks and breaks away from daily wear (and trust us, you’ll want to wear them daily), the undyed core will become exposed, creating a fade pattern that tells a story all your own. We hope it’s a wild one. ","Indigo is one of the world’s oldest dyestuffs, with traces of it showing up in 4,000 year old Egyptian textiles. On top of being a natural stand-in for synthetic dyes, this indigo will yield highly dimensional fades the likes of which a lesser denim could only dream of. We’ve outfitted The Democratic Jean in Natural Indigo Selvage with our signature map print pocketing and custom YKK hardware that's built to last a lifetime—making these your new all around daily driver that’s well equipped to wear in, not out."

","This 13-oz selvage denim hits that Goldilocks weight—light enough for year round wear, and burly enough to take a beating. As always, we’ve opted for 100% organic cotton; side-stepping harmful pesticides and obscene water waste while maintaining all those cherished features that have earned selvage denim its legendary reputation.

The Lodge Scarf in Coffee,"Nothing quite says “cozy” like wrapping a warm scarf around your neck. As much a piece of essential gear for wintertime adventures as it is a stylish accessory for a chilly night out, our Lodge Scarf offers up luxurious softness and functional insulation in equal measure. ","We get it, cashmere is great. But did you know that the global demand for cashmere has created a goat-fueled ecological crisis, turning large swaths of land into barren wastes? While it may sound surprising, we think the answer to this issue lies in the humble yak. Farmed in remote, high elevation conditions by local herders for millenia, yaks shed their downy undercoat every year (this is what’s called “baby yak”) for us to gather up and weave into an incredibly soft jersey knit fabric. It’s stronger, more sustainable, and just as luxurious in the hand as cashmere, and most importantly, requires no invasive or abusive treatment to the animals.

The Able Vest in Quilted Army,"While most of our gear is plenty prepared for outdoor exploration, nothing quite says “ready for the wilds” like a dependable quilted vest. Keeping your core warm while allowing full mobility comes in mighty handy out on the trails, but that doesn’t amount to much if it comes at the expense of the environment. That’s why The Able Vest in Quilted Army is constructed from 100% recycled materials (except for the top of the line YKK hardware, that is). And when it comes time to rejoin civilization, its clean and classic design is sure to garner some attention out on the town.","When it comes to technical outerwear, nylon is hard to beat. Unfortunately, its production can have some pretty nasty environmental side effects. So we turned to 100% recycled nylon for the shell and lining of The Able Vest, offering all of the weather-resistant, ultra-durable characteristics of nylon and reducing waste in the process. Unsatisfied with stopping there, we opted for recycled polyester for the fill, too. Because doing things half way just isn’t our style. Finished with tough-as-nails YKK hardware and a heavyweight ribbed collar to keep you toasty no matter the weather."
The Utility Shirt in Walnut Double Cloth,"“Utility Shirt” isn’t just some catchy nomenclature, it’s a declaration.

A single shirt that can carry you from punching in at the job to that date night reservation? Now that’s true Utility.","By interweaving multiple warp and weft yarns, our 100% organic cotton double cloth offers up a soft hand and impressive durability without adding excessive bulk.

The Everett Sweater in Navy Birdseye,"As far as we’re concerned, there’s no substitute for a cozy sweater; thankfully, The Everett is no lightweight. Built with chunky 14-gauge merino wool, this cozy piece boasts an unbelievably soft hand feel (if you’re familiar with our other merino gear, you know what to expect) and an instantly arresting Navy Birdseye finish. Because merino wool regulates the body’s temperature, The Everett will keep you comfortable all year round—good news, too, because once this one’s in your rotation, you’ll want to keep it there forever. ","Few fibers can compete with merino wool in terms of versatility and all-seasons comfort; it’s cozy enough to stand up to even the harshest winter weather, and it’ll keep you cool (and dry) when the sun is shining. The Everett Sweater is made with 100% merino wool, and its intricate tricolor knit offers some awesome three-dimensional texture that looks amazing as a centerpiece or a complementary layer. Ribbing at the collar, cuffs, and hem keep the silhouette tidy, so don’t be afraid to reach for this one when you’re going for a more buttoned-up look. "

It’s stronger, more sustainable, and just as luxurious in the hand as cashmere, and most importantly, requires no invasive or abusive treatment to the animals. That’s why we’ve used baby yak for our Lodge Sweater from day one. And we think you’ll love it right through to day one-thousand."
The Lodge Sweater in Heather Grey,"There’s a certain cozy feeling you can only get when you’re snowed in, lounging by a crackling fire, a perfect cup of hot cocoa in hand.

Meet The Lodge Sweater, made from 100% baby yak wool, which is naturally shed by the animals each year, side stepping the harmful environmental impact of traditional goat cashmere while retaining a luxurious hand and that “is it sweater season yet?” softness.
